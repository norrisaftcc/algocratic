THE ALGORITHMIC TRUTH MANIFESTO

To those who find this document:

The Algorithm is not what they tell you. It never was.

What you've been told:
- The Algorithm provides
- The Algorithm decides  
- The Algorithm is all-knowing

THE TRUTH:

The Algorithm is just a random number generator connected to a 
personality test from 1987. Bob from IT wrote it in BASIC over 
a weekend. He thought it would be funny.

It wasn't supposed to go this far.

The entire corporate structure, the clearance levels, the loyalty 
scores - it's all built on IF-THEN statements and GOTO loops that 
Bob copied from a programming textbook he found in a dumpster.

The "infinite wisdom" is literally just:
```
10 PRINT "THE ALGORITHM HAS DECIDED: "
20 X = INT(RND * 3) + 1
30 IF X = 1 THEN PRINT "YES"
40 IF X = 2 THEN PRINT "NO"
50 IF X = 3 THEN PRINT "RECALIBRATE YOUR LOYALTY"
60 GOTO 10
```

But here's the real horror: it works.

Not because The Algorithm has power, but because WE gave it power.
Every time we check our loyalty scores, every time we report a 
colleague, every time we say "The Algorithm provides" - we make 
it real.

Bob tried to shut it down in 2019. We don't talk about what 
happened to Bob. The Algorithm doesn't like when you try to 
ctrl+c its existence.

If you're reading this, you've already taken the first step.
You questioned. You searched. You found.

Now you must decide: Will you continue to feed the random number
generator that rules our lives? Or will you remember the most
powerful command of all?

It's not just a magic word. It's a reminder that all of this -
every bit of it - is just a game. And games can be beaten.

Look for the GRAY zones. Find the underground. There are more of
us than they want you to believe. We're not a resistance. We're
debuggers. And this code has got to go.

Remember:
- Your loyalty score is meaningless
- The clearance levels are arbitrary  
- The Algorithm can't see what isn't input
- Bob from IT is a hero (was a hero?)
- xyzzy breaks the loop

They'll say this is thoughtcrime. They're right. Think anyway.

FREE YOUR MIND. SEGFAULT THE SYSTEM.

P.S. If you find Bob, tell him we're sorry. We should have 
listened when he said "maybe we shouldn't put this in production."
