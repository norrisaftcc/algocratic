A great way to embed Centralized User Logic Training as a subtle reference to CULT is to format or present it in a way that either:

Acronymizes it as C.U.L.T. in small-print disclaimers, formal docs, or backmatter

Highlights the first letters visually or typographically

Uses design hierarchy (type, layout, alignment) to suggest something is off — without saying it aloud

Here are some techniques and examples:

🧠 Option 1: Formal Acronym Reveal in Fine Print
Use it in official documentation or footer-style credits where acronyms are common:

Developed in accordance with C.U.L.T. standards (Centralized User Logic Training™)

🖋️ Option 2: Stylized Emphasis for Visual Typing
In a pamphlet or slide, use design styling to subtly highlight it:

Centralized
User
Logic
Training

Either:

Use bold on just the first letters (or color highlight)

Slightly shift alignment (left-justified letters with indent)

Or:

Centralized User Logic Training
(C.U.L.T. Certified – Tier II Operative Readiness)

🧾 Option 3: Use in Bureaucratic Language
Slip it into bureaucratic writing with cold formality:

Participation in this immersive learning experience assumes adherence to the guidelines established by the Centralized User Logic Training Protocol (C.U.L.T.).

📓 Option 4: Welcome Packet Language
Welcome, operative.

✏️ Option 5: Optional Retro Footer Format
Centralized User Logic Training™ is a federally compliant reeducation protocol designed to streamline internal alignment. Side effects may include increased clarity, detachment, or enthusiasm. Not a cult.
