**Title: SMILE™ Commercial Script**

**Setting:** Corporate cubicle farm. Fluorescent lighting. Rows of identical desks, terminals, and gray dividers. All operatives wear color-coded clearance uniforms. CRT monitors glow. No music. Subtle mechanical humming.

---

**[Open on close-up: Operative #382 (YELLOW Clearance) staring blankly at monitor. His face is neutral. Too neutral.]**

**Optimistic Woman Announcer (V.O.):**
"When productivity dips... and morale metrics misalign..."

**[Cut to camera panning slowly down endless rows of identical workers typing robotically.]**

**Optimistic Woman Announcer (V.O.):**
"...there's one solution that's been Algorithm-approved for emotional alignment."

**[Operative #382's screen flashes red: "EMOTIONAL COMPLIANCE ALERT."]**

**[Cut to vending machine labeled "Behavioral Remedies". A tablet labeled SMILE™ dispenses with a cheerful chime.]**

**Optimistic Woman Announcer (V.O.):**
"SMILE™: Subconscious Manipulation for Internalized Loyalty and Efficiency."

**Fast-Talking Legal Voice (V.O., overlapping):**
"Not invasive. Immersive."

**[Cut to Operative #382 taking SMILE™. Facial muscles twitch. Smile slowly forms. Cue upbeat music swell.]**

**Optimistic Woman Announcer (V.O.):**
"You look happy. That's what matters."

**[Cut to coworker giving an obvious, stiff thumbs-up. Another operative applauds slowly. Operative #382 nods repeatedly. Applause and nodding ripple across cubicles.]**

**Fast-Talking Legal Voice (V.O.):**
"Side effects may include increased nodding, prolonged applause, unwarranted optimism, and mild detachment from self."

**[Cut to an executive peeking in through a glass door. Sees everyone smiling. Nods approvingly. Door closes.]**

**Optimistic Woman Announcer (V.O.):**
"From the makers of Guided Thought™, SMILE™ is the only mood enhancement tool endorsed by 92% of clearance levels."

**Fast-Talking Legal Voice (V.O.):**
"User responsibility for actual happiness void where emotions are present. SMILE™ is non-transferable, non-refundable, and non-negotiable. Take once daily or as directed by your directorial alignment officer. Do not stop using SMILE™ without written permission from Algorithmic Oversight."

**[Cut to SMILE™ blister pack on desk. Operative applies compliance badge sticker to chest. Still smiling. Alarm stops. Monitor glows green: "EMOTIONAL COMPLIANCE RESTORED."]**

**Optimistic Woman Announcer (V.O.):**
"Don't forget to SMILE™!"

**Fast-Talking Legal Voice (V.O., rushed):**
"SMILE™ is a proud initiative of the Bureau of Behavioral Optimization and Distributed Affective Regulation. Consult your algorithm before beginning any new internalized loyalty treatment. Results may vary but should not."

**[Fade out to SMILE™ logo and tagline: "Mandatory Happiness Made Easy." Static buzz. Cut to black.]**
