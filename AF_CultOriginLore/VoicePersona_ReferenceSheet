---

## 🎙️ **Voice 01: The Archivist**

**Role:** Intercom Announcer / Lore Keeper / Training Narrator

**Tone:**
Calm, measured, emotionally neutral. Slightly eerie in its steadiness. Should feel like a mix between 1950s public service announcements and a hyper-polished AI documentation voice.

Clarity + Similarity Enhancement: 75–85
Prioritizes articulation and archival sound texture
Style Exaggeration: 0–10
Keep subtle; this voice should not be theatrical

Suggested Base Model Voice (if not cloning):
Rachel or Adam (moderate pitch, adaptable)
Or train a custom model from a historical documentary narrator

American English with *slight* British inflection—crisp articulation without sounding formally British.

## 🎙️ **Voice 02: The Liaison**

**Role:** Front-Facing Operative / HR Personality / Recruitment Host

**Tone:**
Overly enthusiastic, blindly optimistic, cheerfully invasive. Should sound like a highly motivated customer service rep who has been emotionally hijacked by indoctrination. Inspired by *GLaDOS*, corporate onboarding videos, and multi-level marketing pitches.

Vocal Traits:
Mid-to-high pitch
Friendly intonation
Upward vocal inflection on non-questions
Subtle tension behind the smile

Recommended ElevenLabs Settings:
Stability: 40–55
Allows emotional variance for overly expressive tone

Style Exaggeration: 60–80
High exaggeration supports excessive enthusiasm

Suggested Base Model Voice:

Nicole, Bella, or any “excited young adult” clone
Or train with MLM promo videos / HR welcome reels

**Accent:**
American English—warm and upbeat. Artificially sincere.

**Pacing:**
Bright and fast-paced, with a singsong cadence. Frequently emphasizes odd words for emphasis. Slightly breathless from smiling *too much*.

**Ideal Usage:**

* Training videos
* Orientation events
* Scripted interaction tutorials
* Explainer segments

**Sample Phrases:**

* “Congratulations, Cognitive Apprentice! You’ve been *chosen*!”
* “We’re so proud of how much progress you haven’t realized yet!”

## 🎙️ **Voice 03: The Clause**

**Role:** Legal Disclaimer / Rapid Response Compliance Layer

**Tone:**
Flat, clinical, monotone—but fast. Like a radio commercial disclaimer at the end of a pharmaceutical ad. Emotionless but precise.

Vocal Traits:
Mid pitch
Monotone delivery
Very fast pace with precise consonants

Recommended ElevenLabs Settings:
Stability: 85–100
Ensures consistency at high speed
Clarity + Similarity Enhancement: 85–95
Prioritizes intelligibility
Style Exaggeration: 0–15
Keep minimal to avoid tonal expression

Suggested Base Model Voice:
Sam, or clone from fast disclaimers in ads
Can also be built from legal ads, prescription fine print, or fine print from sweepstakes ads

**Accent:**
Standard American or slight Midwestern. Must sound neutral, devoid of charm.

**Pacing:**
Very fast. As fast as possible *without slurring*. No pauses unless legally necessary. Meant to overwhelm or be missed.

**Ideal Usage:**

* Disclaimer overlays
* Legal interruptions
* Audio footnotes
* Subliminal messages

**Sample Phrases:**

* “Alignment may vary. Side effects include recursive thoughts, productivity anxiety, and unauthorized hope.”
* “All feelings are self-regulated. Algorithm assumes no liability for internal misalignment.”
* “Requests for clarity will be ignored for your safety.”
* “This training does not constitute consent.”
* “Progress is simulated. Continue anyway.”

## 🔁 Sample Interaction (for Dialogue Calibration)

**The Liaison:**
“Wow! You’re already halfway through your onboarding loop! That’s *so exciting!*”

**The Clause (interrupting):**
“Excitement not guaranteed. Onboarding status based on simulation data. Subject may be looped indefinitely.”

**The Archivist:**
“Data shows: all journeys begin again. You may proceed.”
