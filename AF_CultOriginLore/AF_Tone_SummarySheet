Algocratic Futures™: Summary Sheet
Overall Theme
A dystopian yet eerily cheerful corporate simulation where The Algorithm governs all decisions. Emotional compliance is expected. Dissent is misinterpreted as an opportunity for improvement.

Participants exist within a bureaucratic machine that denies it’s a cult but displays all the trappings of one.

Tone & Style
Voice: Bureaucratic with a smothering smile. Think HR department meets GLaDOS meets mid-century optimism, dipped in cold satire.

Clearance-Level Satire
Color-coded hierarchy reinforces roles while confusing logic (e.g., GRAY as emotionless design compliance agents)

GRAY = Guidance, Review, Aesthetic Yield

Green Clearance: Technical gatekeepers for architectural absurdity

Yellow/Red/Blue: Rank-and-file behavioral categories

Rank determines access to truth, privileges, and dissatisfaction

Pharmaceutical parody with absurd side effects and mandated cheerfulness

Gray-issued branding kits – for UI design and promotional alignment

Office of Strategic Scarcity Operations™ Stationery – for pointless memos

Typography: Tall, narrow sans-serifs (like Trade Gothic, Univers)

Color: Harvest gold, retro teal, burnout orange, washed-out pinks (midcentury palettes)

Imagery:

Flowcharts as faces

Computer terminals glowing ominously

Rows of operatives in color-coded uniforms saluting data streams

Maze logic posters implying success is predetermined

Props:

Ink stamps for “compliance verified”

Note pads styled like NCR forms

Wall posters with disclaimers and offer terms
