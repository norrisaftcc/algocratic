Below is a curated list of craftable products you can create using your existing design skills and production tools. These are intentionally satirical, immersive, and thematic, drawing directly from the Algocratic Futures™ world, Centralized User Logic Training (CULT) framework, and SMILE™ pharmaceutical parody. Each product idea ties into the tone and disclaimers you've developed — blending dystopian bureaucracy, faux wellness, and enforced enthusiasm — while being realistically achievable using tools like Adobe CC, desktop printers, label paper, or simple craft supplies.
