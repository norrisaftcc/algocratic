# Claude Architectural Decisions and Planning

## Claude Code New Features (July 31, 2025)

### ðŸŽ‰ Claude Code is Now Generally Available!
As of July 30, 2025, Claude Code has transitioned from research preview to general availability, powered by Claude Opus 4.

### Key New Features:

#### 1. IDE Integration & Background Tasks
- **Native VS Code and JetBrains integrations** - Run `claude-code` in your IDE terminal
- **Background tasks via GitHub Actions** - Long-running operations continue even when offline
- **Real-time file edits** - Changes appear directly in your editor for seamless pair programming

#### 2. GitHub Integration (Beta) 
- Tag Claude Code on PRs to:
  - Respond to reviewer feedback
  - Fix CI errors automatically
  - Modify code based on review comments
- Install with: `/install-github-app`

#### 3. Enhanced MCP (Model Context Protocol) Support
- **OAuth 2.0 authentication** with `/mcp` command
- **Remote MCP server support** with native OAuth
- **Resource referencing** using `@server:protocol://path` format
- **SSE and HTTP transports** for MCP servers

#### 4. Claude Code SDK
- Available in **TypeScript and Python**
- Build custom agents on top of Claude Code
- Extensible architecture for enterprise integrations

#### 5. Enterprise Features
- **Administrative dashboard** with real-time metrics
- Track AI tool usage, lines of code accepted, and costs per user
- Team visibility and analytics

#### 6. Platform Updates
- **Windows support** (as of July 16, 2025)
- Available on Pro ($20/month) and Max ($100-200/month) plans
- New weekly rate limits effective August 28, 2025

### Testing Commands
When working with Claude Code features:
- `npm test` - Run unit tests
- `npm run typecheck` - Check TypeScript types  
- `npm run lint` - Check code style
- `/install-github-app` - Set up GitHub integration
- `/mcp` - Configure MCP OAuth connections

### Temporal Integration Guidelines

#### Implemented Future Features (August 2025)
Successfully integrated from future timeline documents without paradox:

1. **Adventure Mode** (`clearance/infrared/adventure_mode.html`)
   - Text-based escape room mechanics adapted from future escape-rooms.md
   - Interactive terminal-style learning environment
   - Programming concept puzzles disguised as corporate training

2. **Metrics Dashboard** (`metrics.html`)
   - Basic surveillance-style productivity tracking
   - Real-time metric fluctuations with algorithmic feedback
   - Foundation for future GitHub API integration

3. **Interactive Society Challenges** (Phreak optimization puzzle)
   - Live code optimization challenges within underground societies
   - Automated feedback system for programming solutions
   - Mathematical problem-solving with immediate scoring

#### Future Integration Pipeline
Documents cataloged in `TEMPORAL_CATALOG.md` for safe implementation:
- Video content integration (multimedia educational materials)
- Advanced GitHub API metrics (real repository data)
- Physical escape room coordination systems
- Community collaboration features

#### Paradox Prevention
- No direct references to "future" sources
- Organic feature introduction as natural evolution
- Simplified implementations initially
- Timeline monitoring for displacement symptoms

## MCP Server Architecture (claude-conduit)

### Purpose
Create an educational MCP server that demonstrates how to connect external models to the Algocratic system, allowing students to interact with slope calculations and transformation functions through Claude Code.

### Key Architectural Decisions

1. **Server Type**: stdio-based MCP server (simplest for students to understand and deploy)
2. **Language**: TypeScript/Node.js (matches Algocratic's tech stack)
3. **Core Features**:
   - Resources: Access to slope calculations, transformation functions, loyalty points
   - Tools: Calculate slopes, apply transformations, simulate loyalty rewards
   - Prompts: Pre-built queries for common student exercises

4. **Project Structure**:
   ```
   claude-conduit/
   â”œâ”€â”€ src/
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.ts          # MCP server entry point
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ resources/        # Resource handlers
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ tools/           # Tool implementations
   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ algocratic/      # Integration with Algocratic logic
   â”œâ”€â”€ examples/            # Student examples
   â”œâ”€â”€ docs/               # Setup and usage guides
   â””â”€â”€ package.json
   ```

5. **Integration Strategy**:
   - Import core algorithms from Algocratic as npm dependency
   - Expose simplified interfaces suitable for teaching
   - Include comprehensive error handling with educational messages

6. **Student Experience**:
   - Single command installation: `npm install -g claude-conduit`
   - Simple configuration in Claude settings
   - Progressive examples from basic to advanced

### Testing Commands
When working on this project, always run:
- `npm test` - Run unit tests
- `npm run typecheck` - Check TypeScript types
- `npm run lint` - Check code style

### Development Philosophy
- **Educational First**: Every design choice should make the system easier for students to understand
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Start simple, reveal complexity gradually
- **Real-World Connection**: Show how MCP servers enable AI to interact with production systems
