## AlgoCratic Futures™ Overview

AlgoCratic Futures™ is an immersive learning experience for software development education. It's a satirical corporate simulation designed to teach teamwork, problem-solving, and professional resilience through exaggerated scenarios. The simulation uses elements from dystopian fiction, corporate culture, and software development chaos to create memorable learning moments.

The educational philosophy centers on immersing students in deliberately absurd scenarios that contain exaggerated versions of real-world challenges, helping them develop both technical skills and professional resilience in a low-stakes, high-engagement environment.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into several key directories:

- `docs/samples/` - Contains example materials including:
  - Orientation materials (orientation-packet.md)
  - Session outlines (corporate-retreat-outline.md)
  - Instructor guidance (instructor-guide.md)
  - Sample requirements (impossible-requirements.md)
  - Tone and style guides (tone-guide.md)
  - Various other simulation materials

- `products/` - Contains different AlgoCratic product simulations:
  - downloadablecontent
  - fitness
  - praisethealgorithm
  - recommendation
  - selfexpression

## Style Guidelines

When creating or modifying content for this repository, maintain the following tonal styles based on document type:

### 1. CORPORATE VOICE (Official Materials)
- Orwellian doublespeak meets Silicon Valley buzzwords
- Cheerful fascism with a UX-friendly veneer
- Contradictory instructions delivered with absolute certainty
- Heavy use of trademark symbols (™)
- Capitalize terms related to authority ("The Algorithm")
- Excessive use of corporate jargon and buzzwords

### 2. UNDERGROUND VOICE (Resistance Materials)
- 90s-era hacker/cyberpunk aesthetic
- Paranoid but pragmatic
- Subversive humor with cynical undertones
- ASCII art and "leetspeak" formatting
- References to classic computing and early internet culture

### 3. BUREAUCRATIC VOICE (Forms & Evaluations)
- Soul-crushing proceduralism
- Psychological manipulation disguised as wellness
- Excessive categorization and numbering
- Fine print with ominous implications

### 4. INSTRUCTOR VOICE (OOC Materials)
- Clear educational rationale
- Practical guidance for implementation
- Explicit connections between satirical elements and learning objectives

## Key Worldbuilding Elements

Maintain consistency with these established elements:

### Clearance Hierarchy
Color-coded system: INFRARED → RED → ORANGE → YELLOW → GREEN → BLUE → INDIGO → VIOLET → ULTRAVIOLET

### The Algorithm
References should maintain ambiguity about whether "The Algorithm" is:
- An actual AI
- A management methodology
- A cult of personality
- A metaphorical concept

### Corporate Newspeak
Use consistent terminology:
- "Resource optimization" (firing)
- "Unexpected features" (bugs)
- "Algorithmic eccentricities" (glitches)
- "Growth opportunities" (problems)
- "Mandatory happiness enhancement" (punishment)

## When Working In This Repository

1. Maintain the satirical corporate dystopian tone appropriate to the document type
2. Create content that balances humor with educational value
3. Ensure new material connects to real-world software development challenges
4. Follow the pattern of gradually escalating absurdity ("The Dystopian Escalator")
5. Remember the educational purpose - using satire as a vehicle for teaching software development principles
