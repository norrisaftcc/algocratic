## CONTENT DEVELOPMENT

### EDUCATIONAL PROGRESSION THROUGH CLEARANCE LEVELS

The clearance level guides serve both as in-character documents and educational resources that support student progression. This system mirrors Bloom's taxonomy and real-world software development environments:

1. **INFRARED (Entry Level - Starting Point)**
   - Mirrors: Knowledge/Remembering in Bloom's taxonomy
   - Real-world parallel: Intern/Probationary developer
   - Focus: Following instructions, basic syntax, tool familiarity
   - Timeline: Students begin here but should advance quickly

2. **RED (Basic Competency - Early Semester)**
   - Mirrors: Comprehension/Understanding in Bloom's taxonomy
   - Real-world parallel: Junior developer with supervision
   - Focus: Building simple features, understanding requirements
   - Timeline: Most students reach this within first few sessions

3. **ORANGE (Developing Skill - Mid-Semester)**
   - Mirrors: Application/Applying in Bloom's taxonomy
   - Real-world parallel: Mid-level developer with some autonomy
   - Focus: Implementing complete features, debugging skills
   - Timeline: Students should reach this by mid-semester

4. **YELLOW (Advanced Capability - Late Semester)**
   - Mirrors: Analysis in Bloom's taxonomy
   - Real-world parallel: Senior developer with specialized expertise
   - Focus: Architecture decisions, problem decomposition
   - Timeline: Better students should reach this by late semester

5. **GREEN (Mastery - End of Semester Goal)**
   - Mirrors: Synthesis/Evaluation in Bloom's taxonomy
   - Real-world parallel: Lead developer with significant autonomy
   - Focus: System design, mentoring, technical leadership
   - Timeline: Goal for students to reach by end of first semester

This progression deliberately encourages autonomy through controlled rebellion—students "earn" their freedom by demonstrating mastery, mirroring how real development shops operate.

- [ ] Ensure compatibility with outdated browsers (by design)
- [ ] Introduce minor glitches that reset loyalty score when discovered

### Monitoring Systems
- [ ] User interaction tracking with loyalty adjustments
- [ ] Session duration monitoring with mandatory breaks
- [ ] Keyboard input analysis for hesitation patterns
- [ ] Scrolling behavior assessment for content engagement

### Browser Support
- [ ] Ensure core functionality on modern browsers

## DEPLOYMENT STRATEGY

### Testing Protocol
- [ ] Verify all clearance-restricted content functions properly
- [ ] Test hidden content accessibility
- [ ] Ensure loyalty tracking system accurately records interactions
- [ ] Validate all forms submit to appropriate endpoints

### Launch Preparation
- [ ] Develop "compliance preparation guide" for users
- [ ] Create announcement materials for mandatory transition
- [ ] Establish countdown timer to migration deadline
- [ ] Prepare contingency plan for resistance to new system
