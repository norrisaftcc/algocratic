It appears the 'underground societies' content is not present as separate files or is not easily discoverable in the repo. This suggests their implementation is either hidden, embedded, or not yet created. To proceed, I recommend clarifying where these society pages are located or outlining how they should be structured in the repoâ€”then tips and metaprompts can be distributed and made interactive as described in the issue.
