This issue collects real-world prompting tips for agent frameworks like PocketFlow, allowing students and developers to share practical prompt patterns and lessons learned. The goal is to build a resource of IRL-tested strategies that make agentic workflows easier and more productive. The seed example shows that if your agent can process enough context, you can provide it the PocketFlow library and prompt it to 'build an agent on this framework,' streamlining development. Everyone is encouraged to add tips that save time and boost productivity!
