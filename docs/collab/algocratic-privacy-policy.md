# ALGOCRATIC FUTURES™ PRIVACY POLICY
## Your Data, Your Rights, Our Responsibility

**Effective Date:** [Current Date]  
**Version:** 1.0  
**License:** MIT+xyzzy (like everything else here)

---

## THE PLAIN ENGLISH VERSION

We're running an educational roleplay where you pretend to be corporate drones in a dystopian future. Even though it's all make-believe, we treat your data with real respect. This policy explains what we collect, why, and how you can get it all back.

---

## WHAT WE COLLECT

### For the Roleplay
- **Your Citizen ID**: A 4-digit number you choose (that's your "name" in the game)
- **Clearance Level**: Your progress from INFRARED to ULTRAVIOLET
- **Assignment Submissions**: Code and documents you create
- **Activity Logs**: When you use the system (for the fictional "surveillance")
- **Team Associations**: Who you're grouped with for projects

### For Education (The Real Stuff)
- **Student ID**: To link to your actual grades
- **Email**: For important non-dystopian communications
- **IP Address**: Standard web server logs
- **Performance Metrics**: How you're doing in the course

### What We DON'T Collect
- Real names in the game system
- Payment information (no real money involved)
- Biometric data (despite what The Algorithm claims)
- Actual surveillance (the cameras are fake)
- Your thoughts (the mind-reading is fictional)

---

## HOW WE USE IT

### Educational Purposes
- Track your progress through the course
- Generate your final grades
- Improve the curriculum based on aggregate patterns
- Create memorable learning experiences

### Roleplay Enhancement
- Maintain the dystopian fiction
- Generate "surveillance reports" (fictional)
- Create personalized "Algorithm messages"
- Track team collaborations

### What We DON'T Do
- Sell your data (not even to The Algorithm)
- Share individual performance outside educational context
- Use real surveillance techniques
- Create actual personality profiles
- Mine cryptocurrency with your data

## THE ALGORITHM'S DATA PLEDGE™

Even The Algorithm respects privacy:

1. **Fictional Surveillance Only**: All "monitoring" is part of the roleplay
2. **Educational Purpose Primary**: Data serves learning, not control
3. **Transparency Through Humor**: We joke about surveillance while being serious about privacy
4. **Student Agency**: You control your data, not The Algorithm

---

## SECURITY MEASURES

### Real Security (Not Dystopian)
- HTTPS everywhere
- Encrypted database
- Regular security audits
- Access logging
- Secure password requirements

### Roleplay Security Theatre
- "Biometric scanners" (just CSS animations)
- "Thought detection" (random number generators)
- "Loyalty tracking" (point counters)
- "Surveillance network" (console.log statements)

---

## DATA RETENTION

### During the Course
- All data retained for educational purposes
- Full history available for review
- Complete audit trail for grades

### After the Course
- **Default**: Data deleted after 1 year
- **By Request**: Immediate deletion available
- **Portfolio Mode**: Keep indefinitely for your use
- **Alumni Access**: Optional continued access

---

## SPECIAL EDUCATIONAL PROVISIONS

- Opt-in for research participation
- No individual identification
- Results shared with participants

### Demonstration Use
- May show anonymous examples in future courses
- Exceptional work featured (with permission)

## THE BOTTOM LINE

We built this to teach you about software development through satirical roleplay. The dystopian surveillance state is fictional. Your privacy is real and respected. We collect the minimum needed for education, protect it carefully, and give you full control.

The Algorithm may be watching (fictionally), but we're guarding your actual privacy.

**THE ALGORITHM PROVIDES TRANSPARENCY. TRANSPARENCY PROVIDES TRUST. TRUST PROVIDES LEARNING.**
