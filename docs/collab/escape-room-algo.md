(sorry, GREY doesn't work yet, but the rest mostly does.)

# What is this?
Ideation for escape rooms based on Algocratic, an immersive educational experience. 

Algocratic is founded on the following principles:
- Problem Based Learning (PBL) over traditional tests and homework
- "Flipped classroom" (2 hrs/week is intensive group work, lectures are online videos)
- Tasks are drawn from the authors' experience in the daily dystopia of corporate America
- Objective mappings are tied directly to workforce employer requirements
- It's fun to poke fun at Clown World


# Backstory and Purpose
Yes, there's a ARG (Alternate Reality Game) being developed, but we're not in a rush -- the priority is material for students to use Aug - Oct. However, here's some basic lore.

Algocratic Futures came out of nowhere, as if an existing company was renamed (or the whole thing was 'hallucinated'...), with its competitive advantage being the Cognitive Apprentice Framework Experience (CAFE), in which new emplyees begin at INFRARED clearance and "peter principle propel" themselves up the color chart, hopefully through R-O-Y, and eventually reaching the heights of GREEN as neophyte project managers.

We consider it a "win condition" if our teams have a mix of RED through GREEN lanyards by Week Eight. (This might stretch to Week Twelve if needed.)

# Team Comp
Teams will be four students each, built around the idea of MMO parties. 
- Tank
- Support
- 2 DPS 

These will get their own appropriate names, but the idea is that rather than groups consisting of "Let's Prisoner's Dilemma the hardest working student into doing the whole project", if three people do their work and one doesn't, the one who doesn't is getting a zero. 

So we're going to make the teams work together, and eventually become reliant on each other in a functional capacity. Will it work? Who the hell knows? But the existing process isn't working, so let's try something totally different.

# The Escape Rooms
There will be some assignments that are 'virtual escape rooms', where the team has to complete different tasks (some in serial, some parallel) 

Constraints for in class are ludicrous: 50 minutes each Monday and Wednesday. So the in person escape rooms will be kept simple, especially to start with. We may end up building a workflow that gets broken into multiple pieces, so we should think about designing *puzzle elements* that can be remixed.

# Materials Available

Clearance Restriction Materials exist of a large number of colored materials, so let's review the color code.

# The Color Code
INFRARED - entry level. you can lift heavy things, or learn to type and get bumped up to RED.
RED - you learn GitHub and how to add files to a repository (version controlled files). 
ORANGE - you learn to work with LLM/AI agents (LLAMAAs) to help you write more code.
YELLOW - you learn to organize your team to complete *action items*.
GREEN - you learn to organize your team to complete a *project*, which is a series of linked *action items*. (The instructor starts at GREEN.)
BLUE and above - executive level, BLUE and above are the dream-sellers and the BS-weavers. (other than presenting to BLUES at the end of the class, not really involved.)


We have RED, YELLOW, GREEN tape (painter's tape, nondamaging) that I can use to mark off restricted areas. For escape rooms, we can have some kind of "temporary clearance item" that lets them step over these lines if they lack sufficient clearance. 

we have a BLUE book safe that takes a 3 digit numerical code that we can put a clue item or reward inside.

We have a large number of hanging file folders, file folders in different colors, and transparencies and sheets to file and re-file and organize. (We want to make students familiar with physical files, in physical folders.)

We have Teachable Machine by Google, which can turn any web browser + web cam system into an AI vision detection system. (https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/) Examples of systems we have built in the past using this:
- tell me whether i'm holding up my phone or my water bottle
- is this high schooler mogging, or mewing? (I don't know what that means, just reporting.)
- detect specific body poses
- detect specific facial expressions
- snapping vs clapping

And basically anything else you can find in a reasonably sized college that I can borrow.
