## ASSESSMENT PHILOSOPHY

AlgoCratic Futures™ assessment balances technical competency evaluation with professional skill development. The satirical corporate simulation provides a safe environment for students to practice resilience, adaptability, and problem-solving while demonstrating technical mastery.

### Core Assessment Principles

1. **Dual Competency Focus**: Both technical skills and professional development are evaluated
2. **Process Over Product**: How students approach problems is as important as the final result
3. **Adaptive Challenge**: Assignments intentionally include ambiguity to test real-world readiness
4. **Peer Learning Integration**: Collaborative work and peer review are assessed components
5. **Satirical Engagement**: In-character participation demonstrates understanding of educational purpose
