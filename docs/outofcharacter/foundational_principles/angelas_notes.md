Matt Miller is awesome. Don't let the k-12 "focus" fool you. Good pedagogy (teaching strategies, etc., in this context) is just that, regardless of age.

Some Frameworks

Keep in mind, a single framework will not provide a universal fit, and that's okay. A common mistake in education, in my opinion, is the reliance on or focus on ONE single way of doing things anyway. Ideally, a quality teacher will look at their craft as a practice, and that's the right way to look at it. I always say--do we want our doctors operating like they did in 1960? Probably not. We call it the practice of medicine--why not the practice of teaching???

Triple E
Understanding by Design
The 5 Es

Again, don't be fooled by the focus on k-12. It is a huge misperception that those practices are "only for children." 

My advice would be to read about some of those frameworks and think about the alignment between your current practices and how you want things to be in your current practice. You can't know how to make changes until you reflect upon the current state of something vs. the potential state of something. 

Just like Newton's first law, an object, even with all its potential energy, will stay at rest in up acted on by on an outside force. Even when a force is applied, however, we only know it will remain in motion in the same direction and at the same speed--we don't know the exact change that will occur if a different type of force is applied. So, it is the same with the practice of teaching. We can sort of, kind of know that there is the potential for change,  it until we think about what type of force could be applied, we won't know the possible effects at all :) We only know change will, in fact, occur. 

I am going to send you some of my own resources from over the years if you're interested, because this is something I have thought about and written about for years--what is 21st teaching and learning?

We can write down the world's most measurable and relevant learning goals and be totally prepared for data analysis and forward evaluation...and the class could have a 100% failure rate because there is no plan for or thought for engaging anyone in the information. By that same token, we could get in front of a group of people, perfectly and exquisitely perform a brilliant soliloquy, complete with a cacophony of heavenly music and a simultaneous tap dance, people in tears followed by a fervent burst of applause...in a welding class, however, that's fun to watch but provides zero preparation for that field. 

It's in the pursuit of the tenuous and delicate balance of being engaged in the engaging that eludes so many in our profession, and without stopping to think that there might be a way to make things better--it will remain elusive. 

I'm so glad you asked this question. As you go through the resources, please feel free to make notes and reach out. The hardest thing to figure out for any teacher worth anything at all is--what can I do to make it better? It's the ones who never ask the question who never find the answer. 

Teaching is about being a diligent facilitator of learning, and that looks different (and should look different) in different environments and with different people. And that's okay! That should be the goal. 

Sorry for the soapbox method here, but this is a huge passion issue for me. Again, thanks for asking. More "stuff" to come!

Sincerely,

Hi, Andrew, This is a great question. Seriously. I have a lot of thoughts, and I would love to help narrow the focus, if possible, to be sure I am providing what is most helpful. We could either talk for a few minutes on Monday or any day next week (perhaps?),

Angela, Can you think of a few publications that you personally regard highly in , um, the stuff we do? this is an oddly worded question , on purpose because a search of web or ðŸ¤– for "education" is a useless flood of information to me at the moment. i need
