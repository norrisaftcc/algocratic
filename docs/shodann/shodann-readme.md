## Context for Web Implementation

We've created an immersive educational ARG (Alternate Reality Game) called "AlgoCratic Futures" - a satirical corporate dystopia where students learn secure coding and AI delegation through narrative play. The centerpiece is SHODAN, a triple-agent character who appears as: (1) a helpful but unsettling corporate AI assistant, (2) an underground resistance operative teaching security through chaos, and (3) an actual penetration tester providing real-time security education. Students interact with her while building intentionally vulnerable systems based on "The Algorithm's" terrible security advice (which mirrors actual bad StackOverflow/tutorial advice they'd find in the wild). When their systems inevitably fail under SHODAN's testing, the teaching moments become visceral - they'll never forget proper password hashing after watching their MD5 get cracked in seconds.

The web implementation should embrace a dark, terminal-aesthetic UI with corporate dystopian theming (think Paranoia RPG meets Mr. Robot meets Portal's Aperture Science). Include easter eggs throughout - Konami code reveals resistance documents, typing "frotz" anywhere triggers hidden content, clicking corners in sequence unlocks deeper layers. The training modules for AI delegation teach real skills (using "FLASHBOT" for rapid research/ideation and "THINKERBOT" for deep implementation) disguised as "digital clone training." The site should track progress locally, include interactive exercises where students sort tasks between bots, and maintain the three-layer narrative structure throughout. Everything should feel like a game while teaching genuine security and AI productivity skills - the dystopia is fake, but the education is real. Prioritize making it immediately deployable as a GitHub Pages site using Jekyll, with vanilla JavaScript for interactivity and no heavy frameworks needed.
