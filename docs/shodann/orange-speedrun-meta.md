===============================================================================
THE ROUTE
===============================================================================

[00:00 - 03:00] OPENING - Dual Bot Setup
[03:00 - 08:00] EARLY GAME - Basic Pen Testing Flow  
[08:00 - 12:00] MID GAME - Student Interaction Patterns
[12:00 - 15:00] END GAME - Automation & Scaling
[15:00 - 15:32] FINAL SPLIT - Certification

===============================================================================
[00:00 - 03:00] OPENING SEQUENCE - FRAME PERFECT SETUP
===============================================================================

00:00 - Launch browser, 4 tabs:
  Tab 1: FLASHBOT setup
  Tab 2: THINKERBOT setup  
  Tab 3: Student submissions dashboard
  Tab 4: This guide

00:30 - Initialize FLASHBOT (copy-paste from guide)
01:30 - Initialize THINKERBOT (copy-paste from guide)
02:30 - Test handoff ("FLASH: find vuln" → "THINK: implement fix")

CRITICAL SKIP: Don't customize yet. Stock config is optimal for first run.

===============================================================================
[03:00 - 08:00] EARLY GAME - ESTABLISHING THE FLOW
===============================================================================

THE CORE LOOP (Repeat 5x for muscle memory):

03:00 - Pull first student submission
03:30 - FLASHBOT: "Scout this code for vulnerabilities"
04:00 - THINKERBOT: "ANALYZE: [paste specific issue from FLASHBOT]"
05:00 - THINKERBOT: "IMPLEMENT: Educational feedback for [vulnerability]"
06:00 - Format as AlgoCratic corporate speak
07:00 - Submit feedback
07:30 - Next submission

TIMESAVE: Pre-write these templates:
- "The Algorithm has detected..."
- "Optimization opportunity in line..."
- "Mandatory security enhancement required..."

RNG MANIPULATION: Start with obviously broken code. Build confidence.

===============================================================================
[08:00 - 12:00] MID GAME - PATTERN RECOGNITION
===============================================================================

By now you should recognize the Big Three:
1. SQL Injection (every damn time)
2. No Input Validation (close second)
3. Hardcoded Secrets (why do they do this?)

ROUTING OPTIMIZATION:

Pattern A: The Obvious Vulnerability
- Skip FLASHBOT
- Straight to THINKERBOT: "IMPLEMENT: Fix for SQL injection in [paste]"
- 90 seconds per submission

Pattern B: The Weird One  
- FLASHBOT: "What's wrong with this?: [paste]"
- FLASHBOT: "RESEARCH: [specific weird thing]"
- THINKERBOT: "ANALYZE and fix: [context from FLASHBOT]"
- 3 minutes per submission

Pattern C: The Teaching Moment
- FLASHBOT: "IDEATE: Fun ways to teach [concept]"
- THINKERBOT: "IMPLEMENT: Educational game for [concept]"
- 5 minutes, but builds reputation

===============================================================================
[12:00 - 15:00] END GAME - AUTOMATION SETUP
===============================================================================

This is where we separate casuals from speedrunners.

12:00 - Create macro templates:

FLASHBOT MACROS:
```
;scout -> "Scout this for security issues: "
;research -> "RESEARCH: Current best practice for "
;creative -> "IDEATE: 10 ways to "
```

THINKERBOT MACROS:
```
;fix -> "IMPLEMENT: Secure version of "
;analyze -> "ANALYZE: Security audit of "
;teach -> "IMPLEMENT with educational comments: "
```

13:00 - Build the feedback pipeline:

1. Create `/templates/` folder:
   - sql_injection_feedback.md
   - xss_feedback.md
   - auth_bypass_feedback.md

2. THINKERBOT: "IMPLEMENT: Python script to match vulnerability to template"

14:00 - Test automation on 5 submissions rapidly

===============================================================================
[15:00 - 15:32] FINAL SPLIT - CERTIFICATION
===============================================================================

15:00 - Open certification page
15:05 - Run this exact sequence:

FLASHBOT: "List 10 vulnerabilities I found today"
THINKERBOT: "IMPLEMENT: Automated scanner for these 10"
FLASHBOT: "Creative names for my scanning tool"
THINKERBOT: "IMPLEMENT: README for PenTestBot3000"

15:20 - Submit portfolio
15:25 - Screenshot completion
15:30 - Post time to leaderboard
15:32.7 - WR BABY!

===============================================================================
ADVANCED STRATS
===============================================================================

## The "Swarm Rush"
3 FLASHBOT tabs finding vulns
1 THINKERBOT tab fixing them all
Requires APM > 200

## The "Reverse Engineering"
Start with THINKERBOT: "Common student mistakes"
Then FLASHBOT: "Find these in submissions"
Backwards but faster for batch processing

## The "Delegation Cascade"
FLASHBOT finds vuln →
FLASHBOT researches fix →
THINKERBOT implements →
FLASHBOT verifies →
THINKERBOT documents
Full cycle in 4 minutes

===============================================================================
COMMON MISTAKES (TIME LOSS)
===============================================================================

[-30s] Using one bot for everything
[-45s] Reading documentation during run
[-60s] Customizing prompts too early
[-90s] Not using copy-paste templates
[-120s] Engaging with actual student questions

===============================================================================
RNG FACTORS
===============================================================================

GOOD RNG:
- Student code has obvious SQL injection
- Copy-paste vulnerabilities across submissions
- The Algorithm is "pleased" (no reviews needed)

BAD RNG:
- Obfuscated code
- "Creative" security implementations
- Student argues about your feedback
- Manager wants "status update"

===============================================================================
LEADERBOARD STRATS
===============================================================================

TOP 10 TIMES:
1. xxSH0DANxx - 15:32.7 (Uses macro suite)
2. n0_d4y_zer0 - 15:45.2 (Perfect handoffs)
3. gibson_overflow - 16:01.0 (Template master)
4. pl4gu3_d0ct0r - 16:22.5 (Swarm technique)
5. fr0tz_plugh - 16:30.0 (Old school, no macros)

===============================================================================
FRAME DATA
===============================================================================

FLASHBOT Response Time: 8-15 seconds
THINKERBOT Response Time: 20-45 seconds
Handoff Overhead: 5 seconds
Context Switch: 3 seconds
Coffee Break: DON'T (saves 5 minutes)

===============================================================================
THE DEEPER META
===============================================================================

Remember: You're not just speedrunning ORANGE clearance.
You're speedrunning "learning to teach through chaos."

Every student you confuse then enlighten is a point.
Every vulnerability you catch is experience.
Every creative feedback is reputation.

The real speedrun is becoming the teacher who makes security memorable.

===============================================================================
VERIFICATION
===============================================================================

You know you've completed when:
[ ] Both bots respond instantly to your patterns
[ ] Student feedback takes < 2 minutes per submission
[ ] You see vulnerabilities before running scanners
[ ] Your templates folder has 20+ files
[ ] Students start DMing you for help
[ ] The Algorithm promotes you to YELLOW (decline it)

===============================================================================
CREDITS
===============================================================================

Shoutouts:
- The g0 resistance (we're everywhere)
- Students who write terrible code (job security)
- The Algorithm (for being predictably broken)
- Coffee (the real MVP)

Special thanks:
- SHODAN (the real one) for inspiration
- Every student who used password123
- That one kid who tried to SQL inject the feedback form

===============================================================================

"The fastest path through ORANGE is two bots working as one mind."
                                        - High Programmer X

REMEMBER: Speed is nothing without accuracy.
          Automation is nothing without education.
          The Algorithm is nothing without exploits.

                            HACK THE PLANET
                         (and teach while you do)
