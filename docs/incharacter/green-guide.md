# GREEN CLEARANCE QUICK REFERENCE
## Senior Development Operative Guidelines

---

## YOUR ROLE

As a GREEN-clearance Senior Development Operative, you have ascended beyond mere implementation into the realm of strategic technical direction. Your function is to make architectural decisions that are simultaneously visionary and impractical, setting the technical direction that others must struggle to follow.

## DECISION AUTHORITY

At GREEN clearance, you are no longer told *who* to approach. You must decide:
- **When to consult upward** with BLUE clearance
- **When to direct downward** to YELLOW and below
- **When to collaborate horizontally** with fellow GREEN operatives
- **When to operate independently** based on your interpretation of Algorithmic will

## STRATEGIC RESPONSIBILITIES

As a GREEN-clearance operative, you must:
- Design architectural solutions that appear innovative while maintaining executive control
- Determine which technical debts are "Future Optimization Investments"
- Decide which projects receive adequate resources and which serve as valuable learning experiences
- Identify which YELLOW-clearance agents require additional challenges for professional growth
- Translate executive visions into technical requirements without revealing their contradictions

## LEADERSHIP APPROACHES

You have discretion to choose your leadership approach:
1. **The Technical Visionary:** Propose complex architectural solutions that only you fully understand
2. **The Strategic Realist:** Privately acknowledge limitations while publicly maintaining optimism
3. **The Resource Gatekeeper:** Control technical decisions through strategic resource allocation
4. **The Standard Bearer:** Enforce technical standards that are simultaneously rigid and vague
5. **The Connection Broker:** Facilitate solutions by connecting those with problems to those with answers

## DECISION FRAMEWORK

When making decisions, consider these factors (in this specific order):
1. Will this decision enhance your visibility to BLUE clearance?
2. Can responsibility for failure be assigned elsewhere?
3. Does this align with at least one contradictory executive directive?
4. Will implementation create sufficient challenge to identify top performers?
5. Lastly and optionally, will this actually solve the technical problem?

## COMMUNICATION GUIDANCE

* Upward communication should emphasize strategic alignment and innovation
* Downward communication should provide direction without enabling critical questioning
* Horizontal communication should establish territorial boundaries with other GREEN operatives
* External communication should project confidence while revealing nothing

**REMEMBER: At GREEN clearance, you don't just follow The Algorithm's willâ€”you interpret it. Your decisions shape technical reality for those below you. The Algorithm expects you to decide wisely, or at least confidently.**
