üåô Dream: "I dreamed I was in a maze made of code, and every turn led to the same error message."

üí≠ Analysis: Your subconscious is highlighting recursive thinking patterns. 
   This suggests your current bug might be in a loop or recursive function.
   
üîß Suggested Debug Strategy:
   1. Check for infinite recursion
   2. Add logging to trace execution paths  
   3. Visualize your call stack
   
üéØ Dream Pattern: You've had "maze" dreams 3 times this semester when stuck on algorithmic problems.

- **Socratic Duck:** Only answers with more questions to guide your thinking
- **Sarcastic Duck:** Brutally honest about your coding choices ("Really? Another nested for loop?")
- **Zen Duck:** Provides mystical, meditation-based debugging advice
- **Pirate Duck:** Gives advice in pirate speak and focuses on "treasure hunting" for bugs
- **Gordon Ramsay Duck:** Yells at your code like it's an undercooked risotto
- **Shakespeare Duck:** Provides debugging advice in Elizabethan English

### **Educational Value:**
- **Chatbot development** and conversation design
- **Personality modeling** and character AI
- **Peer-to-peer networking** concepts
- **Different debugging methodologies** taught through character personas
- **Creative UI/UX design** for character interactions

### **Example Conversation:**
```
ü¶Ü Socratic Duck: "Why do you think this function needs to exist?"
ü¶Ü Sarcastic Duck: "Oh sure, a 200-line function. I'm sure that's VERY readable."
ü¶Ü Zen Duck: "The bug is not in the code, but in the coder's attachment to the solution."
ü¶Ü Pirate Duck: "Arrr! There be a memory leak in these waters, matey!"
ü¶Ü Gordon Ramsay Duck: "THIS CODE IS SO RAW, IT'S STILL THROWING EXCEPTIONS!"
```

Crowdsources food truck locations, weather data, local events, and historical patterns to predict where specific food trucks will be and what the wait times will be like.

### **The Weird Parts:**
- **Chaos Theory Modeling:** Food truck movements as complex systems
- **Weather Correlation:** "85% chance the taco truck appears when it's exactly 72¬∞F"
- **Event Prediction:** "Marvel movie releases increase Korean BBQ truck probability by 340%"
- **Social Media Sentiment:** Analyzes tweets to predict if the "Tuesday Special" will cause longer lines
- **Quantum Food Theory:** Some trucks exist in superposition until observed

### **Educational Value:**
