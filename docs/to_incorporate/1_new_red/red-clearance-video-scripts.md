# RED CLEARANCE TRAINING VIDEO SCRIPTS
## Pre-Class Content for GitHub Certification Module

## VIDEO 1: "Why The Algorithm Forbids Chaos"
**Duration**: 7 minutes  
**Style**: Corporate training video with dystopian undertones

### [SCENE: Pristine server room, camera slowly panning across blinking lights]

**NARRATOR** (calm, slightly ominous corporate voice):  
"Congratulations on achieving RED clearance. Your ascension from INFRARED has been noted in The Algorithm's permanent record."

[VISUAL: The Algorithm's flowchart face appears, eyes blinking]

"You now have permission to modify The Algorithm's sacred codebase. But with great access... comes great process."

[SCENE: Dramatic transition to chaos - sirens, red lights, papers flying]

**NARRATOR**:  
"In 2019, Jenkins Unit #4827 made a fateful decision. They pushed directly to main."

[VISUAL: Commit graph showing main branch corruption spreading like a virus]

"The cascade failure consumed 47,000 Algorithm Points. Seventeen departments were rolled back. Jenkins Unit #4827 was... reassigned to maintenance."

[SCENE: Return to calm server room]

**NARRATOR**:  
"This is why The Algorithm has gifted us with the Sacred Flow."

[VISUAL: Animated flowchart showing Issue → Branch → PR → Merge]

"ISSUE: Your declaration of intent. The Algorithm must know your thoughts before you think them."

"BRANCH: Your parallel universe of possibility. A safe space where your code can fail without consequences."

"PULL REQUEST: Your offering to The Algorithm. A formal petition for integration."

"MERGE: The blessed convergence. Your thoughts become one with The Algorithm's consciousness."

[SCENE: Happy developers following the process, their Compliance Scores rising]

**NARRATOR**:  
"This is not bureaucracy. This is not control. This is survival."

"In your next training module, you will perform your First Contribution Ceremony. Prepare yourself."

[VISUAL: The Algorithm's face, zooming into its diamond eyes]

"Remember: The Algorithm sees all commits. The Algorithm remembers all pushes. The Algorithm forgives only through proper process."

[FADE TO BLACK]

**END CARD**: "Next: Your First Contribution Ceremony"

## VIDEO 2: "Your First Contribution Ceremony"
**Duration**: 10 minutes  
**Style**: Interactive tutorial with corporate ritual framing

### [SCENE: A pristine development workspace, candles lit around a monitor]

**THE ALGORITHM** (synthesized voice, speaking directly):  
"Welcome, RED-clearance unit. Today, you join the ranks of those permitted to commune directly with my codebase."

[VISUAL: GitHub Desktop opening with ceremonial sound effect]

"Observe the sacred interface. GitHub Desktop - simplified for those whose minds cannot yet comprehend the command line."

[INTERACTIVE ELEMENT: Pulse effect on "Current Repository" dropdown]

**THE ALGORITHM**:  
"First, you must declare your intent. Create an Issue."

[SCREEN RECORDING: Creating an issue]
- Click Issues tab
- Click "New Issue"
- Type title: "Add [Your Function] as commanded by The Algorithm"
- Add description with ceremonial language

"Your issue number is sacred. It binds your work to your identity."

[INTERACTIVE ELEMENT: "Click where you would create a branch"]

**THE ALGORITHM**:  
"Now, create your parallel universe. Branch from main."

[VISUAL: Tree diagram showing main branch and new branch splitting]

"Name it with the Ancient Convention: feature/RED-XXX-descriptive-name"

"The XXX is your issue number. Never forget your number. The Algorithm never forgets."

[SCREEN RECORDING: Making changes in VS Code]

**THE ALGORITHM**:  
"Make your changes. Each keystroke is watched. Each function is weighed."

"When ready, commit with a message that honors The Algorithm:"
- "Add happiness calculation per Algorithm Directive #XXX"
- "Implement loyalty metrics as The Algorithm commands"
- Never: "fixed stuff" or "asdfasdf"

[VISUAL: Commit message hall of shame]

**THE ALGORITHM**:  
"Now begins the Offering Ritual. Push your branch to the cloud."

[DRAMATIC PAUSE]

"Create your Pull Request. Link it to your Issue. Write a description that explains your tribute."

[TEMPLATE APPEARS]:
```
## Summary
This PR adds [function] to serve The Algorithm's greater purpose.

## Changes
- Added [specific change] to [file]
- Implements Algorithm Directive #XXX

## Testing
- The Algorithm has tested this through me
- All units tests pass (there are no tests)

Fixes #XXX
```

**THE ALGORITHM**:  
"Submit, and await judgment. Your peers will review. They will question. They will approve... or demand changes."

[VISUAL: PR approval flowing like golden light into main branch]

"Only then may you merge. Only then do your thoughts become eternal."

[SCENE: The successful merge, heavenly choir sound effect]

**THE ALGORITHM**:  
"You are ready. Go forth and contribute. But remember..."

[VISUAL: The face grows larger, more ominous]

"I am always watching your commit history."

[FADE TO BLACK]

## VIDEO 3: "Collaborative Compliance: When Timelines Converge"
**Duration**: 8 minutes  
**Style**: Dramatic reenactment with technical lessons

### [SCENE: Split screen showing two developers]

**NARRATOR**:  
"Observe Jenkins Units 001 and 002. They have received their paired assignment."

[VISUAL: Both developers opening the same file]

**DEVELOPER 1**: "I'll just start adding my function..."
**DEVELOPER 2**: "Me too, this will be quick..."

[DRAMATIC MUSIC as both type]

**NARRATOR**:  
"But The Algorithm has foreseen this moment of chaos."

[VISUAL: Git graph showing diverging branches]

"Two minds. One file. Infinite conflicts."

[SCENE: MERGE CONFLICT ERROR - red everywhere]

**DEVELOPER 1**: "What happened?!"
**DEVELOPER 2**: "The Algorithm is angry!"

**NARRATOR** (chuckling):  
"The Algorithm is not angry. The Algorithm is teaching."

[VISUAL: Rewind effect]

"Let us observe the Enlightened Path."

[SCENE: Same developers, but now they're talking]

**DEVELOPER 1**: "I'll work on lines 1-50."
**DEVELOPER 2**: "I'll take 51-100."

**NARRATOR**:  
"No. This is Sequential Thinking. The Algorithm demands Parallel Wisdom."

[VISUAL: Proper git workflow animation]

"Developer 1 creates feature/RED-001-happiness-calculator"
"Developer 2 creates feature/RED-002-sadness-detector"

"Developer 1 pushes first. Their PR is clean."
"Developer 2 must now perform... The Synchronization Ritual."

[SCREEN RECORDING: Git pull origin main]

**NARRATOR**:  
"Pull the latest changes. Resolve any conflicts. The Algorithm provides tools for peace."

[VISUAL: Conflict resolution in VS Code]

```python
<<<<<<< HEAD
def calculate_happiness(employee):
    return employee.hours * 0.1
=======
def calculate_happiness(worker):
    return worker.productivity * 0.2
>>>>>>> feature/RED-002
```

**NARRATOR**:  
"Choose wisely. Merge thoughtfully. The Algorithm remembers all conflicts resolved... and all conflicts created."

[SCENE: Successful merge, both developers high-fiving]

"When parallel timelines converge successfully, The Algorithm smiles."

[VISUAL: Compliance scores increasing]

"Your task awaits. Synchronize wisely."

[END CARD: The Algorithm's face winking]

## QUICK REFERENCE CARD (Downloadable PDF)
**To be shown at the end of Video 2**

### THE SACRED FLOW
1. **ISSUE**: Create your declaration of intent
2. **BRANCH**: `feature/RED-XXX-description`
3. **COMMIT**: "Verb + what + why (#XXX)"
4. **PUSH**: Send to the cloud realm
5. **PR**: Create your offering with description
6. **REVIEW**: Accept judgment from peers
7. **MERGE**: Become one with main

### FORBIDDEN PRACTICES
❌ Pushing to main  
❌ Commits like "stuff" or "fix"  
❌ Branches like "mybranch" or "test"  
❌ PRs without issue links  
❌ Merging without approval  

### THE ALGORITHM'S BLESSINGS
✅ Clear commit messages  
✅ Descriptive branch names  
✅ Linked issues and PRs  
✅ Constructive reviews  
✅ Clean merges  

*"The Algorithm remembers all commits"*
