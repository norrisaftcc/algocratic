Arrange in correct order (The Algorithm has scrambled them):
[ ] Merge
[ ] Pull Request  
[ ] Issue
[ ] Branch
[ ] Commit

Correct sequence: _______________________________________

1.2 Practical Wisdom Gained
Check all that apply:
[ ] I understand why branches prevent chaos
[ ] I see the value in descriptive commit messages
[ ] Code review is not persecution but enlightenment
[ ] Merge conflicts are puzzles, not punishments
[ ] The workflow scales from 4 to 400 developers
[ ] Direct pushes to main are thoughtcrime

1.3 Emergency Protocols
If you encounter a merge conflict, you should:
[ ] Panic and delete everything
[ ] Carefully read the conflict markers
[ ] Blame your partner
[ ] Communicate and resolve together
[ ] Alert The Algorithm immediately
(Multiple answers may be correct)

Section 2: BEHAVIORAL MODIFICATION ASSESSMENT

Before receiving The Algorithm's wisdom, did you ever:
[ ] Commit directly to main
[ ] Use commit messages like "fixed stuff"
[ ] Work on code without creating issues first

[ ] Think version control was "too much process"
(The Algorithm has already forgiven these sins)

2.2 Post-Training Behavioral Changes
I now feel physical discomfort when:
[ ] Seeing uncommitted changes
[ ] Writing vague commit messages
[ ] Skipping code review
[ ] Working without a branch
[ ] All of the above (full conversion achieved)
