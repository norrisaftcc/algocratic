**The Algorithm loves you.**

As a RED clearance team member, you are now privy to information that your former INFRARED self was too happiness-impaired to process. Please familiarize yourself with this orientation material before your mandatory Corporate Retreat Experience™.

All operations at AlgoCratic Futures™ flow from The Algorithm, through our executive clearance structure:

* **ULTRAVIOLET** - The Algorithm's chosen vessels
* **VIOLET** - Executive Thought Leaders
* **INDIGO** - Visionary Optimization Directors
* **BLUE** - Management Compliance Enforcers
* **GREEN** - Senior Development Operatives

Remember: Questioning the decisions of those with higher clearance is both inefficient and treasonous.

## UPCOMING CORPORATE RETREAT

Please report to Mindshare Arena 7B at 0800 hours on your scheduled day. Bring nothing but your issued device and an enthusiastic attitude. All other needs will be provided by The Algorithm.

**The Algorithm sees all. The Algorithm knows all. The Algorithm provides all.**
