## COST OPTIMIZATION MATRIX™

The Algorithm mandates maximum efficiency through pay-per-use economics:

| Service | Free Tier Allocation | Scaling Protocol |
|---------|---------------------|------------------|
| Supabase | 500MB database | Auto-scale on demand |
| Vercel | 100GB bandwidth | Edge caching enabled |
| Upstash | Pay-per-request | Redis cache optimization |
| Cloudflare | 100k requests/day | Global distribution |
| Streamlit | Unlimited public apps | Private tier available |

**Directive**: Begin with free allocations. Scale only when The Algorithm demands.

## DEVELOPER PRODUCTIVITY PROTOCOLS

### Local Development Environment
```bash
# All infrastructure remains cloud-delegated
npm install -g @algocratic/cloudsync-cli
cloudsync init --clearance=INFRARED

# Streamlit deployment
streamlit run citizen_dashboard.py --cloud

# Edge function testing
vercel dev --algorithm-optimized
```

### AI-Assisted Development Workflow
```javascript
// Context7 + Cursor Integration Example
// Prompt: "Create student submission processor"
// Context7 provides: Latest Supabase Edge Function docs
// Result: Working code in <30 seconds
// Productivity Gain: 1000%
```
