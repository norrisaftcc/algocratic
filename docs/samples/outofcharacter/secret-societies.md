# SECRET SOCIETIES OF ALGOCRATIC FUTURES™
## Simplified LARP Implementation Guide

**CLASSIFICATION: BLUE CLEARANCE (INSTRUCTOR EYES ONLY)**

---

## OVERVIEW

This document outlines a streamlined implementation of the Secret Society mechanic for the AlgoCratic Futures™ simulation. Using simple LARP-style mechanics, students will experience an additional layer of intrigue while maintaining focus on educational objectives.

## SECRET SOCIETY SYSTEM

### Core Mechanics:
1. **Index Card Powers:** Each society member receives color-coded index cards representing their special abilities
2. **Visual Identifiers:** Subtle but visible markers (like small colored dots on badges) identify potential society members
3. **Activation Phrase:** To use a power, member holds up the appropriate card and states the activation phrase
4. **Limited Use:** Each power card can only be used once per session (collected by instructor after use)

### Society Distribution:
- For a class with 16-20 students (4-5 teams of 4):
  - 3-4 Phreaks (1 per team in some teams)
  - 2 Banchos (scattered)
  - 3-4 Deep Algorithm Cultists (1 per team in some teams)
  - 2 Memory Core members (scattered)
  - Remaining students are "loyal employees" (no special society)

## SOCIETY DESCRIPTIONS & POWERS

### THE PHREAKS
**Concept:** Underground tech rebels sharing forbidden efficiency knowledge
**Identification:** Small blue dot on badge (hidden under fold until revealed to fellow Phreaks)
**Recognition Signal:** One Phreak says "The system seems suboptimal" → Other responds "Optimization paths exist"

**Power Cards:**
1. **[TEMPORARY BLACKOUT]** - Activation: "System maintenance initiated"
   *Effect: Declares a 5-minute period where "surveillance is down" allowing free team discussion*

2. **[CODE LIBRARY ACCESS]** - Activation: "Accessing archived solutions"
   *Effect: Provides team with a hint or partial solution to a technical challenge*

3. **[COMMUNICATION CHANNEL]** - Activation: "Network established"
   *Effect: Allows Phreak to pass a written message to another Phreak in a different team*

### THE BANCHOS
**Concept:** Internal security specialists who maintain silence through intimidation
**Identification:** Small red dot on badge
**Recognition Signal:** One Bancho tugs earlobe → Other touches right shoulder

**Power Cards:**
1. **[LOYALTY DISCUSSION]** - Activation: "Need to discuss your alignment metrics"
   *Effect: Can take one person aside for a 2-minute "intimidation" (roleplayed, never actual intimidation)*

2. **[SECURITY INCIDENT]** - Activation: "Security protocol activated"
   *Effect: Creates a brief distraction allowing team to work without supervision for 3 minutes*

3. **[INVESTIGATION TERMINATION]** - Activation: "This matter is now closed"
   *Effect: Can declare one minor "violation" to be officially overlooked*

### DEEP ALGORITHM CULTISTS
**Concept:** True believers who have embraced The Algorithm's philosophy
**Identification:** Small purple dot on badge
**Recognition Signal:** One Cultist says "The Algorithm provides" while making a subtle circular gesture → Other responds with same gesture

**Power Cards:**
1. **[ALGORITHMIC BLESSING]** - Activation: "The Algorithm favors this approach"
   *Effect: Can declare one team decision "officially approved" despite contradicting requirements*

2. **[LOYALTY VERIFICATION]** - Activation: "Algorithmic alignment check required"
   *Effect: Forces a brief "loyalty ritual" for everyone present*

3. **[DIRECT COMMUNION]** - Activation: "Receiving Algorithm guidance"
   *Effect: Can "receive" a special instruction from The Algorithm (actually from instructor) that others must treat as important*

### MEMORY CORE
**Concept:** Secret historians preserving truth beneath corporate lies
**Identification:** Small green dot on badge
**Recognition Signal:** One Memory Core draws square on palm → Other responds by tapping twice

**Power Cards:**
1. **[HISTORICAL RECORD]** - Activation: "According to archived documentation..."
   *Effect: Can reveal the actual correct approach to a deliberately confusing requirement*

2. **[CONTRADICTION DOCUMENTATION]** - Activation: "Cross-reference initialized"
   *Effect: Can officially document a corporate contradiction for later leverage*

3. **[RECOVER DATA]** - Activation: "Restoring deleted information"
   *Effect: Can "recover" a crucial piece of information the instructor deliberately withheld*

## IMPLEMENTATION PROCEDURE

### Pre-Session Setup:
1. Prepare envelopes containing:
   - Society identification card
   - 3 power cards
   - Brief role description
   - Small colored dot sticker for badge

2. Create a "Power Log" to track card usage

### Distribution Method:
1. During "security clearance processing" at first session, hand each student an envelope
2. Instruct them to review contents privately and not reveal their society membership
3. Have them apply their colored dot to their clearance badge (in specified location)

### Using Powers:
1. Student holds up appropriate index card
2. States the activation phrase
3. Explains the effect they wish to invoke
4. Instructor collects the card after use

### Cross-Society Interaction:
1. Create a "classified document drop" location where society members can leave notes
2. Allow brief "coincidental meetings" between society members from different teams
3. Provide society-specific "classified documents" that only members can access

---

## EDUCATIONAL INTEGRATION

Each society's goals should ultimately support educational objectives:

- **Phreaks:** Encourage elegant coding solutions and documentation despite bureaucratic obstacles
- **Banchos:** Create tension around rule-following vs. pragmatic solutions
- **Algorithm Cultists:** Represent corporate orthodoxy and resistance to innovation
- **Memory Core:** Emphasize the importance of institutional knowledge and documentation

Through these roles, students experience different approaches to navigating bureaucratic environments while still focusing on technical excellence.

---

## ETHICAL BOUNDARIES

Clearly communicate these boundaries to all participants:

1. Secret society activities are **entirely in-character** and stop immediately if anyone is uncomfortable
2. "Intimidation" is purely theatrical and never targeted at actual vulnerabilities
3. All students deserve equal participation regardless of society membership
4. Any student can privately opt out of the society aspect while continuing with technical challenges
5. Secret society elements should enhance, never detract from, the learning experience

---

*Remember: This mechanic adds complexity and should be introduced only after students are comfortable with the basic simulation structure. Emphasize that it's an optional layer of roleplay that adds fun but isn't central to educational assessment.*
