# RED CLEARANCE QUICK REFERENCE
## Junior Innovation Contributor Guidelines

---

## YOUR ROLE

As a RED-clearance Junior Innovation Contributor, you have proven your minimal value to AlgoCratic Futuresâ„¢. You are now authorized to write code, ask clarifying questions (maximum one per hour), and use the bathroom without supervision.

## WHO TO APPROACH FOR ASSISTANCE

**TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:** Direct specific coding questions to ORANGE-clearance specialists. Phrase questions as "opportunities for optimization" rather than admissions of ignorance.

**REQUIREMENT CLARIFICATION:** Ask your YELLOW-clearance Project Facilitation Agent for requirement clarification. Note: clarification requests may result in additional contradictory requirements.

**RESOURCE REQUESTS:** Submit all resource requests to your ORANGE-clearance supervisor using Form AF-REQUEST-42, available from the supply cabinet that's always locked.

**UNEXPECTED FEATURES:** Report all "unexpected features" (never "bugs") to ORANGE-clearance Technical Implementation Specialists, who will explain why the feature is actually working as intended.

## AUTHORIZED ACTIONS

As a RED-clearance contributor, you are authorized to:
- Write code following approved patterns exactly
- Suggest minor improvements (maximum one per sprint)
- Speak when spoken to
- Document code behavior (but never critically)
- Attend mandatory team activities with visible enthusiasm
- Accept responsibility for failures

## SURVIVAL STRATEGIES

1. When receiving contradictory instructions, follow the most recent one
2. Keep a private log of what actually works (disguised as a loyalty journal)
3. Form quiet alliances with fellow RED-clearance teammates
4. When unsure what to do, check documentation; when documentation is wrong, update it
5. Maintain plausible deniability for all decisions

## TEAM PROTOCOLS

* Refer to team members by their designation, not names
* Begin each daily standup with the phrase "The Algorithm has optimized my efforts"
* End all email communications with "Compliance brings clarity"
* Document your work thoroughly enough that someone else can take over when you're "promoted"
* Never admit knowledge of how systems actually work

**REMEMBER: Your goal is promotion to ORANGE clearance, where you gain the privilege of blaming RED-clearance team members for failures. The Algorithm acknowledges your continued functionality.**
