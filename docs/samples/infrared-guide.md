# INFRARED CLEARANCE QUICK REFERENCE
## Probationary Resource Unit Guidelines

---

## YOUR ROLE

As an INFRARED-clearance probationary resource unit, you exist in a state of algorithmic evaluation. Your primary function is to demonstrate sufficient compliance and technical aptitude to justify promotion to RED clearance.

## WHO TO APPROACH FOR ASSISTANCE

**IMMEDIATE SUPERVISOR:** Your assigned RED-clearance team leader is your primary point of contact for all questions, concerns, and existential crises.

**TECHNICAL QUESTIONS:** Direct all coding inquiries to ORANGE-clearance Technical Implementation Specialists.

**PERMISSION REQUESTS:** Route all permission requests through your RED-clearance team leader, who will reject them.

**EMERGENCY SITUATIONS:** In case of critical technical failures or spontaneous code combustion, alert your ORANGE-clearance supervisor immediately. Do not attempt to resolve emergencies yourself, as this implies you understand the system better than The Algorithm.

## PROHIBITED ACTIONS

As an INFRARED-clearance unit, you are prohibited from:
- Making independent decisions
- Having unapproved ideas
- Speaking directly to anyone YELLOW clearance or above
- Using the terms "bug," "problem," or "mistake"
- Leaving your assigned workstation without authorization
- Understanding the bigger picture

## SURVIVAL TIPS

1. Always appear busy, even when waiting for instructions
2. Document everything (but never in a way that implies criticism)
3. Practice saying "The Algorithm provides" with varying intonations
4. Maintain a facial expression of mild confusion mixed with enthusiasm
5. If you don't know what to do, clean your workspace until instructions arrive

## PERFORMANCE EXPECTATIONS

Your performance is measured by:
- Speed of task completion
- Enthusiasm during mandatory group activities
- Frequency of asking permission before acting
- Compliance with contradictory instructions
- Willingness to take blame for unexpected features

**REMEMBER: Promotion to RED clearance is your only path to receiving a name instead of your numerical designation. The Algorithm watches your efforts with mild interest.**
