# Basic Algorithmic Calculation Module
## *Initial Assessment for Probationary Resource Units*

The Algorithm has determined that your cognitive processing potential
requires preliminary evaluation before you may be assigned more complex
tasks. This assignment will confirm your ability to perform the most
basic algorithmic operations.

    1. Accept the number of correct answers and total questions
    2. Return a percentage (0-100) representing loyalty
    3. Ensure a minimum loyalty score of 50% (The Algorithm is merciful)
    
    Args:
        correct_answers: Number of correct responses
        total_questions: Total number of questions asked
