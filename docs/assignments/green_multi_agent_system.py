## *Multi-Agent Deliberation Implementation for Strategic Resource Allocation*

The Algorithm has determined that this project requires implementation of 
Advanced Reality Formation via Multi-Agent deliberation techniques. As a GREEN
clearance operative, you are tasked with constructing a simulated cognitive 
collective that achieves superior decision-making through dialectical synthesis.

RESOURCE ALLOCATION TIMELINE: 180 MINUTES

Fragmentationâ„¢ and is punishable by immediate clearance reduction.
