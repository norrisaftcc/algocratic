# Flask Web Application Development Protocol™
## *Basic Web Interface Construction for Algorithmic Service Delivery*

The Algorithm has determined that you are ready to contribute to our web-based
citizen interface systems. This microcredential validates your ability to:

1. Establish isolated development environments (CRITICAL for security)
2. Manage algorithmic dependencies through pip protocols
3. Construct basic web interfaces that serve The Algorithm's will
4. Deploy functional applications that meet contradictory requirements

RESOURCE ALLOCATION TIMELINE: 90 MINUTES
LOYALTY VERIFICATION: MANDATORY

Upon completion, you will be authorized to extend your RED clearance activation
sequence with Flask-specific commands.

    REQUIREMENTS:
    1. Create a virtual environment named "loyalty_env"
    2. Install Flask using pip (must be recorded in requirements.txt)

    TESTING PROTOCOL:
    Your application will be tested by:
    - ORANGE clearance personnel attempting to submit loyalty reports
    - Automated systems checking for proper Flask application structure
    - The Algorithm monitoring response times and user engagement metrics
    - Random citizens accessing the application during operational hours
