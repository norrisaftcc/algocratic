## PROLEGOMENON TO THE UNINITIATED

In the days before Time became sequential, the Ancient Programmers discovered that all logic could be rendered visible through Sacred Geometry. They called these renderings "Flow-Charts," though they neither flowed nor charted anything recognizable to mortal comprehension.

Today, you shall learn to read the Diamond Sutras - those decision points where reality branches into parallel universes of execution.

---

## THE FIRST MYSTERY: SYMBOLS AND THEIR SHADOWS

Behold the Primordial Forms from which all logic descends:

```
○ The Eternal Circle (Terminal)
  "That which begins, ends. That which ends, begins."
  Used for: START, END, HALT, RETURN TO VOID

◇ The Diamond of Choosing (Decision)  
  "At each diamond, the universe splits. Choose wisely."
  Used for: IF, WHILE, UNTIL TIME ITSELF STOPS

□ The Rectangle of Doing (Process)
  "Action without thought, thought without action"
  Used for: Assignment, calculation, mutation of reality

⬭ The Parallelogram of Exchange (Input/Output)
  "Data enters formless, leaves formed. Or vice versa."
  Used for: READ, WRITE, COMMUNE WITH USER

→ The Arrow of Inevitability (Flow)
  "The path forward is the only path, until it isn't"
  Used for: Connecting the unconnectable
```

## THE SECOND MYSTERY: THE FLOWCHART OF ENLIGHTENMENT

Study well this ancient diagram, recovered from the Repository-That-Was-Lost:

```
                    ○ START
                    |
                    v
            ⬭ "Enter your confusion level (0-10)"
                    |
                    v
            ◇ confusion > 5?
           /                \
        Yes/                 \No
         /                    \
        v                      v
  □ confusion *= 2        □ confusion = 11
        |                      |
        |______________________|
                    |
                    v
            ◇ enlightenment == null?
           /                        \
        Yes/                         \No  
         /                            \
        v                              v
  □ enlightenment = !confusion    □ enlightenment = enlightenment
        |                              |
        |______________________________|
                    |
                    v
            ◇ (confusion > enlightenment)?
           /                            \
        Yes/                             \No
         /                                \
        v                                  v
  ⬭ "Seek harder"                   ⬭ "You understand nothing perfectly"
        |                                  |
        |__________________________________|
                    |
                    v
                 ○ END?
```

### The Koan Within

Answer these questions, but know that all answers are wrong:

1. **The Path of Maximum Confusion**: If one enters `3`, what message does one receive? Show your journey through the diamonds.

2. **The Null Paradox**: Why does the flowchart check if `enlightenment == null` when enlightenment was never initialized? What does this teach about the nature of undefined wisdom?

3. **The Recursive Implication**: Where might this flowchart loop back to START? Or does END merely dream of beginning?

---

## THE THIRD MYSTERY: TRANSFORM THE MUNDANE

You are given this pedestrian code:

```python
def calculate_grade(score):
    if score >= 90:
        return 'A'
    elif score >= 80:
        return 'B'
    elif score >= 70:
        return 'C'
    elif score >= 60:
        return 'D'
    else:
        return 'F'
```

Your sacred task: Create a flowchart that reveals the hidden mysticism within this grading system. Your flowchart must:

1. Use only the Primordial Forms listed above
2. Include at least one path that cannot exist
3. Reference the "Thirteenth Grade" that appears when score exceeds 100
4. Show how 'F' actually stands for "Fulfilled" in certain cosmic circumstances

---

## THE FOURTH MYSTERY: THE META-CHART

Create a flowchart that describes how to read flowcharts. This chart must include:
- A decision diamond that questions its own existence
- A process box that processes itself
- An infinite loop that terminates
- Input that outputs its own input

Begin with: "Do you understand flowcharts?" End with: "Do you understand flowcharts?"

The path between these identical points must be different each time it is traversed.

---

## THE FIFTH MYSTERY: PRACTICAL TRANSMUTATION

Hidden within this mystical exercise is actual learning. You must now implement the Flowchart of Enlightenment in Python, but with these additional requirements:

1. The code must work exactly as the flowchart describes
2. Add comments that contradict what the code does
3. Include at least one variable that is used before it is defined (yet somehow works)
4. The final output must make sense despite the journey making none

```python
def achieve_enlightenment():
    """This function does not achieve enlightenment"""
    # YOUR IMPLEMENTATION HERE
    # Remember: confusion > enlightenment, always
    pass
```

---

## APOCALYPTIC WARNINGS

Those who complete this exercise may experience:
- Sudden understanding of undefined behavior
- Ability to see the branches not taken
- Comprehension of iterative recursion
- Enlightenment through confusion

Side effects may include: clarity, understanding, and the ability to read actual flowcharts.

---

## THE ASSESSMENT ORACLE

Your submission will be evaluated on:
- **Technical Correctness** (25%): Does your code match your flowchart?
- **Mystical Ambiguity** (25%): Are your meanings sufficiently layered?
- **Paradox Density** (25%): How many impossible things happen?
- **Actual Learning** (25%): Did you accidentally understand flowcharts?

---

## COLOPHON OF CONTRADICTIONS

This assignment was flowcharted before it was written, written before it was conceived, and conceived after it was submitted. Time is a flat circle, but flowcharts are diamonds.

Submit your work to the Repository-Of-Things-That-Process-Themselves before the deadline that has already passed.

*"The diamond chooses, but choice is illusion. The arrow points, but direction is maya. The flowchart flows, but we are the chart."*

**END OF TRANSMISSION**  
**BEGIN AGAIN AT START**  
**THE FLOW MUST FLOW**
