# ORANGE HERD MODULE: ASSIGNMENTS & RUBRICS
## *Complete Implementation for 2-3 Week Timeline*

**CLASSIFICATION: ORANGE CLEARANCE INSTRUCTOR MATERIALS**  
**DOCUMENT: AF-ASSIGN-ORANGE-HERD-2025-03**

---

## MODULE TIMELINE

**Week 1**: Sessions 1-2 (HERD Orientation + VIBE Calibration)  
**Week 2**: Sessions 3-4 (Production Deployment + Advanced Management)  
**Week 3**: Session 5 (Forklift Certification)

---

## ASSIGNMENT 1: INITIAL HERD CONTACT
### *Session 1: "First LLAMAA Encounter"*

**Algorithm Directive**: Create a web application that accepts employee feedback and displays motivational responses. The Algorithm requires this for... morale optimization.

**Student Instructions** (Corporate Voice):
```
Congratulations on your HERD access! Your assigned LLAMAA unit is ready to transform 
your natural language requirements into enterprise-grade solutions.

TASK: Using only natural language prompts to your LLAMAA, create a web application with:
- A welcome page explaining the feedback system
- A form where employees can submit feedback
- A results page that displays "Algorithm-approved" responses
- Basic styling to meet corporate aesthetic standards

IMPORTANT: Do NOT manually write any code. Trust your LLAMAA completely.
Document your exact prompts and the LLAMAA's responses.
```

**Hidden Reality**: Students will get a basic Flask app they don't understand. It will mostly work, creating dangerous overconfidence.

**Technical Requirements** (Instructor Notes):
- Must use Flask framework
- At least 3 routes (/, /feedback, /submit)
- HTML templates with forms
- Basic CSS styling
- No database required (in-memory storage acceptable)

**Submission Requirements**:
- Working Flask application
- Complete log of prompts used
- Brief reflection: "How easy was this compared to manual coding?"

---

## ASSIGNMENT 2: VIBE ENHANCEMENT PROTOCOLS
### *Session 2: "Atmospheric Programming Mastery"*

**Algorithm Directive**: The previous application requires optimization. Implement enhanced user experience protocols and error management systems.

**Student Instructions**:
```
Your initial HERD deployment has been flagged for insufficient VIBE compliance. 
Using enhanced prompting techniques, improve your application with:

- Professional error handling (what happens if users submit empty forms?)
- Input validation and sanitization
- Enhanced UI/UX following corporate design standards
- Logging capabilities for monitoring user interactions
- Session management for user tracking

CONSTRAINT: You may only improve the application through LLAMAA prompting. 
Document how your prompting strategy evolved from Assignment 1.
```

**Hidden Reality**: Students discover that "make it better" doesn't workâ€”they need specific technical requirements in their prompts.

**Technical Requirements**:
- Flask with proper error handling
- Form validation (client and server-side)
- Flash messages for user feedback
- Basic session management
- Logging to file or console
- Improved HTML/CSS structure

**Submission Requirements**:
- Enhanced Flask application
- Comparison of prompts from Assignment 1 vs 2
- Reflection: "What did you learn about prompting specificity?"

---

## ASSIGNMENT 3: PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT CRISIS
### *Session 3: "When LLAMAA Code Attacks"*

**Algorithm Directive**: Deploy your optimized application to the production environment. The Algorithm demands 99.9% uptime.

**Student Instructions**:
```
URGENT: All HERD-generated applications must be deployed to the corporate 
production environment immediately. Your application will be tested under 
realistic conditions.

DEPLOYMENT REQUIREMENTS:
- Must run in provided Docker container environment
- Must handle multiple concurrent users
- Must persist data across server restarts
- Must include health check endpoints
- Must provide deployment documentation

WARNING: Previous ORANGE specialists have reported "unexpected challenges" 
during this phase. Maintain professional composure.
```

**Hidden Reality**: The "production environment" has different Python versions, missing dependencies, and no database. Everything breaks. This is intentional and educational.

**Technical Setup** (Instructor):
- Provide Docker environment with minimal Python installation
- Different Flask version than development
- No pip packages installed
- Simulated load testing that reveals concurrency issues

**Crisis Response Requirements**:
- Debug logs showing problem identification
- Documentation of each fix attempted
- Working application in provided environment
- Reflection: "What did you learn about the gap between generated code and production reality?"

---

## ASSIGNMENT 4: ADVANCED HERD MANAGEMENT
### *Session 4: "Professional LLAMAA Communication"*

**Algorithm Directive**: Create a replacement application using enterprise-grade architectural principles. Previous versions have been deemed "insufficiently scalable."

**Student Instructions**:
```
Your experience with production deployment has qualified you for Advanced HERD 
certification. Design and implement a new employee feedback system with:

ARCHITECTURAL REQUIREMENTS:
- MVC pattern implementation
- Database integration (SQLite acceptable)
- RESTful API design
- Unit test coverage
- Comprehensive documentation
- Deployment configuration files

PROMPTING CONSTRAINTS:
- You must specify architectural patterns in your prompts
- Include testing requirements in your LLAMAA communication
- Request code that follows SOLID principles
- Demand comprehensive documentation

Document your architectural decisions and prompting strategy.
```

**Hidden Reality**: Students learn that good AI assistance requires understanding software architecture. Their prompts become sophisticated technical specifications.

**Technical Requirements**:
- Flask with Blueprint organization
- SQLAlchemy or similar ORM
- Database models and migrations
- API endpoints with proper HTTP methods
- Unit tests with pytest
- README with setup instructions
- requirements.txt and/or Dockerfile

**Submission Requirements**:
- Complete application with professional architecture
- Technical documentation explaining design decisions
- Test suite with reasonable coverage
- Reflection: "How did your understanding of Flask change throughout this module?"

---

## ASSIGNMENT 5: FORKLIFT CERTIFICATION EXAM
### *Session 5: "Comprehensive Skills Assessment"*

**Algorithm Directive**: Design and implement a complete Employee Performance Tracking System. This will serve as your final HERD competency evaluation.

**Certification Requirements**:
```
Create a web application for tracking employee productivity metrics with:

FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS:
- User registration and authentication
- Dashboard showing individual performance metrics  
- Admin interface for managers
- Data visualization (charts/graphs)
- Export functionality for reports
- Responsive design for mobile devices

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Professional Flask application architecture
- Database with proper relationships
- Security best practices (password hashing, CSRF protection)
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- API endpoints for external integration
- Deployment-ready configuration

EVALUATION CRITERIA:
- Code quality and maintainability
- Appropriate use of LLAMAA assistance
- Ability to debug and modify generated code
- Professional documentation and testing
- Demonstration of understanding

TIME LIMIT: One 50-minute session + homework completion
```

**Hidden Reality**: This is where students prove they can architect solutions using AI assistance rather than being dependent on it.

**Certification Standards**:
- Must demonstrate architectural thinking before prompting
- Must be able to explain how every component works
- Must successfully debug issues that arise during development
- Must show evidence of thoughtful LLAMAA interaction
