   - Complex system orchestration
   - Event-driven and message-passing architectures

2. **Real-World Software Engineering Challenges:**
   - Designing systems that balance competing priorities
   - Building frameworks that integrate diverse perspectives
   - Creating extensible architectures that can evolve
   - Implementing algorithms that synthesize disparate inputs

3. **Professional Competencies:**
   - Systems thinking and holistic perspective
   - Handling competing stakeholder requirements
   - Building consensus across technical disciplines
   - Making principled trade-offs with incomplete information

## ASSIGNMENT STRUCTURE & PROGRESSION

### Conceptual Framework

This assignment satirizes corporate "consensus-building" processes while teaching students to build a legitimate multi-agent system. The humor lies in the overwrought corporate language around what is essentially a weighted decision-making algorithm, but the technical skills developed are directly transferable to real-world applications including:

- Recommendation systems
- Automated decision support tools
- Consensus algorithms
- Multi-stakeholder requirement reconciliation

### Technical Components

The assignment breaks down into these core challenges:

1. **Agent Implementation:**
   - Create specialized "cognitive agents" with different priorities
   - Implement perspective generation based on agent type
   - Design algorithms for proposal evaluation and critique

2. **Deliberation System:**
   - Build an orchestration system for agent interaction
   - Create dialectical processes for proposal refinement
   - Implement synthesis algorithms for integrating perspectives

3. **Evaluation Methods:**
   - Develop metrics for measuring deliberation quality
   - Create algorithms for assessing perspective integration
   - Implement validation against constraints and requirements

## IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE

### Setting Up the Assignment

1. **Classroom Introduction:**
   - Present this as a "senior engineering challenge" requiring systems thinking
   - Emphasize the real-world parallel of building consensus among stakeholders
   - Connect to actual multi-agent systems in industry (recommendation engines, etc.)

2. **Suggested Group Structure:**
   - Teams of 3-4 students
   - Assign specialized roles that mirror the agent archetypes
   - Encourage actual debate about implementation approaches

3. **Environment Preparation:**
   - Ensure Python 3.7+ environment with standard libraries
   - No special packages required, but students may add them with justification
   - Optional: Provide visualization tools for deliberation process

### Execution Approach

1. **Scaffold Progressive Implementation:**
   - Start with basic agent implementation and testing
   - Move to simple deliberation between two agents
   - Scale to full multi-agent system with synthesis
   - Add evaluation and documentation components

2. **Key Learning Moments to Emphasize:**
   - Designing for extensibility (adding new agent types)
   - Balancing competing priorities algorithmically
   - Creating algorithms that produce consensus from disagreement
   - Implementing systems that document their own decision processes

3. **Common Challenges & Solutions:**

   | Challenge | Pedagogical Approach |
   |-----------|----------------------|
   | Overly complex agent design | Guide toward simplification and well-defined interfaces |
   | Weak synthesis algorithms | Emphasize weighted combination strategies and trade-off identification |
   | Poor process documentation | Stress the importance of explainable AI and decision transparency |
   | Ignoring constraints | Reinforce validation against all specified constraints |

## TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION TIPS

When students struggle with specific components:

### Agent Implementation

```python
# Example approach for agent perspective generation
def evaluate_proposal(self, proposal):
    alignment_score = 0
    reasoning_points = []
    
    # Evaluate based on agent's priorities
    for priority in self.priorities:
        if priority in proposal and proposal[priority] > 0.6:
            alignment_score += 0.1
            reasoning_points.append(f"Strong alignment with {priority}")
        elif priority in proposal and proposal[priority] < 0.3:
            alignment_score -= 0.1
            reasoning_points.append(f"Poor alignment with {priority}")
    
    # Apply archetype-specific evaluation
    if self.archetype == AgentArchetype.RESOURCE_OPTIMIZATION:
        efficiency = self._calculate_resource_efficiency(proposal)
        alignment_score += efficiency * 0.3
        reasoning_points.append(f"Resource efficiency calculated at {efficiency:.2f}")
    
    return Perspective(
        strength=min(max(0.3 + alignment_score, 0), 1),
        reasoning="; ".join(reasoning_points),
        supporting_evidence=self._gather_evidence(proposal),
        counter_arguments=self._identify_weaknesses(proposal),
        alignment_score=alignment_score
    )
```

### Synthesis Implementation

```python
# Example approach for perspective synthesis
def synthesize_final_solution(self, proposals, perspectives):
    # Identify common elements across proposals
    common_elements = self._find_common_elements(proposals)
    
    # Calculate weighted value for each proposal component
    component_scores = {}
    for agent, proposal in proposals.items():
        for component, value in proposal.items():
            if component not in component_scores:
                component_scores[component] = []
            
            # Weight by agent's perspective strength and alignment
            agent_weight = 0
            for critic, persp_map in perspectives.items():
                if agent in persp_map:
                    agent_weight += persp_map[agent].strength * persp_map[agent].alignment_score
            
            weighted_value = value * (1.0 + agent_weight)
            component_scores[component].append((weighted_value, agent))
    
    # Create synthesis by taking highest weighted components
    synthesis = {}
    for component, scores in component_scores.items():
        if len(scores) > 0:
            # Take average of top half of weightings
            sorted_scores = sorted(scores, reverse=True)
            top_half = sorted_scores[:max(1, len(sorted_scores)//2)]
            synthesis[component] = sum(score for score, _ in top_half) / len(top_half)
    
    # Integrate common elements with higher confidence
    for component, value in common_elements.items():
        if component in synthesis:
            synthesis[component] = (synthesis[component] + value * 2) / 3
        else:
            synthesis[component] = value
    
    # Add synthesis rationale
    synthesis['rationale'] = self._generate_synthesis_rationale(
        proposals, perspectives, synthesis)
    
    return synthesis
```
