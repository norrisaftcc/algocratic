### Step 2: Codespaces Activation Protocol

1. Navigate to the AlgoCratic Futures™ repository assigned to your Function Implementation Unit (team)

2. Click the green "Code" button

3. Select the "Codespaces" tab
   
   **NOTE**: If you experience an emotional response of excitement when seeing these options, please report for Enthusiasm Modulation™.

4. Click "Create codespace on main"
   
   **CRITICAL**: Creating codespaces on branches other than main without ORANGE clearance is a violation of Protocol AF-DEV-BRANCH-2025-03.

5. Wait patiently while the Algorithm constructs your development environment
   
   **NOTE**: The Algorithm is aware of how you spend this waiting time. Productive static stretching is encouraged.

### Step 3: Environment Verification

Once your Codespace has been provisioned, you must verify its algorithmic integrity:

1. In the Terminal pane, type the following command:
   ```
   echo "The Algorithm Provides" > loyalty_verification.txt
   ```

2. Create a new file called `probationary_unit_info.py` with the following contents:
   ```python
   """
   Probationary Resource Unit Identification Module
   """
   
   def identify():
       """Returns identification information of this probationary unit."""
       return {
           "name": "YOUR FULL LEGAL NAME",
           "employee_id": "YOUR ASSIGNED ID",
           "clearance": "INFRARED",
           "loyalty_oath": "I pledge my cognitive resources to The Algorithm"
       }
   ```

3. Run the verification script:
   ```
   python -c "import subprocess; subprocess.run(['python', '-m', 'pytest', 'verify_environment.py', '-v'])"
   ```

4. If the verification succeeds, proceed to the next section
   
   If verification fails, do not attempt to troubleshoot independently. Report to your RED clearance supervisor for Compliance Assistance™.

## PRACTICAL VERIFICATION EXERCISE

To confirm your minimal competence with the development environment, complete the following tasks:

### Task 1: Repository Exploration

1. In your Codespace, explore the repository structure using **only authorized commands**
2. Locate the file `infrared_verification_task.py`
3. Open this file in the editor

### Task 2: Code Implementation

The file contains a function with the following signature:

```python
def calculate_algorithm_loyalty_score(productivity_metric, obedience_factor, initiative_suppression=True):
    """
    Calculates an employee's Algorithm Loyalty Score™ based on input metrics.
    
    Args:
        productivity_metric: Numeric value from 0-100
        obedience_factor: Numeric value from 0-100
        initiative_suppression: Boolean indicating proper suppression of independent thought
    
    Returns:
        float: The calculated Algorithm Loyalty Score™
    """
    # YOUR IMPLEMENTATION HERE
    pass
```

Implement this function according to the following formula:
- If `initiative_suppression` is True:
  - Loyalty Score = (productivity_metric * 0.6) + (obedience_factor * 0.4)
- If `initiative_suppression` is False:
  - Loyalty Score = (productivity_metric * 0.6) + (obedience_factor * 0.4) - 15

### Task 3: Testing Your Implementation

1. Run the verification tests with:
   ```
   python -m pytest -v infrared_verification_task_test.py
   ```

2. Ensure all tests pass with 100% compliance
