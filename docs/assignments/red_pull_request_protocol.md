# ALGORITHMIC REVISION SUBMISSION PROTOCOL™
## *Official Change Request Procedure for Code Modification Entreaties*

**CLASSIFICATION: RED CLEARANCE**  
**DOCUMENT: AF-DEV-PR-R-2025-05**

---

## ATTENTION RED CLEARANCE JUNIOR INNOVATION CONTRIBUTORS

Your assigned task parameters include mandatory implementation of the Algorithmic Revision Submission Protocol™ (commonly referred to by unauthorized slang term "pull request"). This standardized procedure ensures all code modifications receive proper oversight, validation, and integration approval before contaminating the Authorized Central Code Repository.

**FAILURE TO FOLLOW THIS PROTOCOL WILL RESULT IN IMMEDIATE CODE REJECTION AND LOYALTY SCORE REDUCTION.**

---

## PROTOCOL PREREQUISITES

Before initiating an Algorithmic Revision Submission Protocol™, confirm the following prerequisites:
1. Valid RED clearance identification code
2. Authorized workstation connection to Version Control System
3. Completion of "Procedures for Proper Procedural Processing" training module
4. Approved Developer Key with minimum 67.2% loyalty rating
5. Documented approval from ORANGE or higher clearance supervisor
6. Completion of pre-submission checklist (Form AF-DEV-CHKLST-2025-05)

---

## STEP 1: INITIAL DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS

Complete the following documentation with meticulous attention to detail:

1. Fill out the Code Modification Intent Declaration (Form AF-DEV-INTENT-2025-05)
   - State formal purpose in approved corporate language
   - Declare all modified files with byte count deltas
   - Provide technical justification using only approved terminology
   - Calculate and document Algorithmic Impact Assessment score
   - Obtain two (2) digital signatures from peers of equal or higher clearance

2. Complete Risk Assessment Matrix (Form AF-DEV-RISK-2025-05)
   - Evaluate potential fallout scenarios from code modification
   - Quantify probability of service disruption (0.0001% - 99.9999%)
   - Document loyalty-adjusted confidence interval
   - Provide contingency measures for all scenarios above 2.7% probability

3. Submit Digital Loyalty Oath affirming your:
   - Unwavering dedication to The Algorithm
   - Acknowledgment that all code belongs to AlgoCratic Futures™
   - Recognition of your own insignificance in the greater algorithmic ecosystem
   - Acceptance of all penalties for submission failure

---

## STEP 2: TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION PROCEDURE

After documentation approval (allow 3-5 business days), proceed with technical implementation:

```bash
# 1. Synchronize with Authorized Central Code Repository
git pull origin main

# 2. Create isolated innovation branch with approved naming convention
git branch AF-DEV-[YOUR_ID]-[TICKET_NUMBER]-[APPROVED_KEYWORD]

# 3. Activate isolated innovation environment
git checkout AF-DEV-[YOUR_ID]-[TICKET_NUMBER]-[APPROVED_KEYWORD]

# 4. Implement authorized modifications (refer to your approved specification document)
# [IMPLEMENT CHANGES HERE]

# 5. Document all changes according to Corporate Documentation Standard R-7.3
git add [MODIFIED_FILES]
git commit -m "PROD-[TICKET_NUMBER]: [APPROVED_CHANGE_DESCRIPTION]"

# 6. Synchronize with Authorized Central Code Repository again
git pull origin main

# 7. Resolve any synchronization conflicts, if present
# [RESOLVE CONFLICTS IF NECESSARY]

# 8. Publicize your innovation branch to the repository
git push -u origin AF-DEV-[YOUR_ID]-[TICKET_NUMBER]-[APPROVED_KEYWORD]
```

## STEP 3: ALGORITHMIC REVISION SUBMISSION CREATION

Navigate to the AlgoCratic Code Management Portal and complete the following fields in exact order:

1. **Title**: Use the format "PROD-[TICKET_NUMBER]: [APPROVED_CHANGE_DESCRIPTION]"
2. **Description Template**: Copy and paste the following, filling ALL fields:
   ```
   ## Purpose of Modification
   [DESCRIBE PURPOSE USING APPROVED TERMINOLOGY ONLY]

   ## Implementation Approach
   [DESCRIBE IMPLEMENTATION USING TECHNICAL LANGUAGE]

   ## Testing Methodology
   [DESCRIBE TESTING PROCEDURES PERFORMED]

   ## Risk Mitigation Strategy
   [DESCRIBE HOW RISKS IDENTIFIED IN FORM AF-DEV-RISK-2025-05 ARE MITIGATED]

   ## Impact Assessment
   [INCLUDE ALGORITHMIC IMPACT SCORE WITH 3 DECIMAL PRECISION]

   ## Loyalty Declaration
   I, [YOUR FULL LEGAL NAME], hereby declare that these modifications serve only The Algorithm and have been implemented according to all AlgoCratic Futures™ standards and protocols. I accept all consequences for any deficiencies discovered in this submission.
   ```
3. **Assignees**: Your ORANGE clearance Technical Implementation Specialist and one randomly selected peer
4. **Labels**: Minimum of 7 labels from the Approved Label Taxonomy
5. **Projects**: Your assigned Algorithmic Enhancement Initiative
6. **Milestone**: Current sprint designation
7. **Attached Documentation**: All completed forms from Step 1

---

## STEP 4: REVIEW AND APPROVAL PROCESS

After submission, your code will enter the official Review and Approval Process:

1. **Initial Automated Evaluation** (24-48 hours)
   - Loyalty-adjusted code quality metrics
   - Algorithmic alignment assessment
   - Documentation completeness verification
   - Corporate language compliance check

2. **Peer Review Phase** (3-5 business days)
   - Minimum of 2 peers must approve
   - Any criticism must be addressed within 24 hours
   - Criticism response requires Form AF-DEV-DEFENSE-2025-05
   - Failure to adequately address criticism may result in submission termination

3. **ORANGE Clearance Technical Validation** (5-7 business days)
   - Technical Implementation Specialist will evaluate code
   - May request additional documentation or modifications
   - Three rejection maximum (third rejection results in mandatory Loyalty Reassessment)

4. **YELLOW Clearance Project Authorization** (variable timeframe)
   - Project Facilitation Agent will assess project alignment
   - May delay integration based on strategic priorities
   - Approval includes final integration scheduling

5. **Integration Scheduling** (1-3 weeks)
   - Your code will be queued for integration during the next available maintenance window
   - You must be available for immediate consultation during integration
   - Any integration failures are your responsibility
   - Successful integration will be documented in your personnel file

## COMMON CAUSES OF SUBMISSION REJECTION

- Improper documentation formatting
- Using unapproved terminology or slang
- Excessive or insufficient comments
- File modification without explicit authorization
- Layout modifications deviating from Corporate Visual Identity
- Excessive creativity or innovation beyond scope
- Questioning the review process
- Showing impatience with review timeline
- Loyalty score below threshold during submission window
