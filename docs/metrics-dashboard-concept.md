# AlgoCratic Metrics Dashboard: "The Algorithm Watches"

## Concept Overview
An entertaining dystopian metrics dashboard that tracks repository activity as if it were employee productivity in the AlgoCratic system.

## Features

### 1. Burndown Charts
- **"Sacred Flow Velocity"**: Sprint/issue burndown with ominous red zones
- **"Compliance Trajectory"**: PR merge rate vs "algorithmic expectations"
- **"Productivity Quotient"**: Commits per day with "minimum acceptable" thresholds

### 2. Repository Statistics
- **"Contribution Compliance Score"**: Gamified contributor rankings
- **"Code Churn Surveillance"**: Lines added/removed with "waste detection"
- **"Issue Resolution Efficiency"**: Time to close with "delinquency warnings"

### 3. Multi-Repo Tracking
- **"Department Performance Matrix"**: Compare multiple repos
- **"Cross-Functional Synergy Metrics"**: Collaboration between repos
- **"Algorithmic Alignment Index"**: How well repos follow "best practices"

## Technical Implementation

### MVP with Streamlit
```python
# Example structure
import streamlit as st
import pandas as pd
from github import Github

st.title("üîç ALGOCRATIC PERFORMANCE METRICS")
st.subheader("The Algorithm Sees All")

# Sidebar for repo selection
selected_repos = st.sidebar.multiselect(
    "Select Repositories for Surveillance",
    ["algocratic", "algocratic-deploy", "algocratic-wiki"]
)

# Burndown chart with dystopian styling
st.plotly_chart(create_burndown_chart(repo_data))

# Contributor "compliance" scores
st.metric("Your Productivity Score", "87%", "-3%", 
          help="Warning: Below algorithmic expectations")
```

### Integration Points
1. **Location**: `/website/metrics/` or subdomain `metrics.algocratic.io`
2. **Authentication**: Use clearance levels for data access
3. **Styling**: Match AlgoCratic phosphor green aesthetic

### Data to Track
- Commit frequency and size
- PR velocity and review times  
- Issue lifecycle metrics
- Contributor activity patterns
- Code quality metrics (if available)

### Dystopian Elements
- Red alerts for "underperforming" metrics
- Surveillance camera icons
- "Employee of the Algorithm" leaderboards
- Ominous tooltips ("Your commits are being monitored")
- Glitch effects on concerning metrics

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Static Demo
- Mock data showing "ideal" AlgoCratic metrics
- Basic Streamlit app with core visualizations
- Deploy as standalone demo

### Phase 2: Live GitHub Integration
- Connect to GitHub API
- Real-time data from algocratic repos
- Basic caching for performance

### Phase 3: Full Integration
- Embed in main website
- Clearance-based access control
- Historical data tracking
- Export "performance reports"

## Example Metrics Messages
- "Your commit velocity has decreased 12%. The Algorithm is concerned."
- "Repository health: ACCEPTABLE (barely)"
- "Collaboration index: SUBOPTIMAL - increase cross-functional commits"
- "Sprint burndown trajectory: ON TRACK (The Algorithm is pleased)"

## Benefits
- Entertaining addition to the AlgoCratic universe
- Actually useful project metrics
- Demonstrates technical capabilities
- Potential recruitment tool (shows GitHub integration skills)
