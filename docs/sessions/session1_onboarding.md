#### Cycle 4: Competitive Response (25 minutes)
1. **Market Intelligence (5 minutes)**
   - Announce "Competitor product detected, must differentiate immediately"
   - Add entirely new feature requirements without extending timeline
   - Provide bizarre "market research" with impossible user requests

2. **Development Time (15 minutes)**
   - Teams incorporate new features while maintaining previous requirements
   - Removed team members return but are given conflicting information

3. **Efficiency Metrics (5 minutes)**
   - Teams must report on efficiency metrics that weren't previously defined
   - React with concern regardless of what metrics are reported

#### Cycle 5: Final Implementation (25 minutes)
1. **Final Directive (5 minutes)**
   - Announce "The Algorithm has determined the final product direction"
   - Provide somewhat more coherent requirements that still contain subtle contradictions
   - Emphasize that presentation will occur immediately after this cycle

2. **Development Time (15 minutes)**
   - Teams finalize implementation
   - Instructors provide cryptic hints about evaluation criteria

3. **Preparation for Demonstration (5 minutes)**
   - Teams prepare for demonstration
   - Distribute "Presentation Compliance Guidelines" with excessive rules

### Phase 3: Demonstration Protocol (30 minutes)
1. **Team Presentations (20 minutes)**
   - Each team presents their MindMeld™ implementation
   - Instructors interrupt with bizarre questions
   - RED clearance assistants take notes on arbitrary aspects of presentations

2. **Performance Evaluation (10 minutes)**
   - Teams are evaluated on arbitrary criteria not previously disclosed
   - Some teams receive "provisional RED clearance" based on seemingly random factors
   - Announce that all implementations will be "appropriately utilized by The Algorithm"

## DETAILED IMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES

### Contradictory Requirements Matrix
Ensure each specification update includes at least one direct contradiction with previous requirements:

| Aspect | Initial Requirement | Cycle 2 Change | Cycle 3 Change | Cycle 4 Change | Cycle 5 Resolution |
|--------|---------------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|-------------------|
| Platform | Desktop application | Mobile-first web app | Must work offline | Cloud-based service | Progressive web app |
| UI | Simple, intuitive | Feature-rich, comprehensive | Minimal interaction | Immersive experience | Adaptive interface |
| Security | Basic authentication | Military-grade encryption | User anonymity | Complete data collection | Contextual security |
| Data | Local storage | Cloud synchronization | No data retention | Complete history | Selective persistence |
| Performance | Speed prioritized | Feature completeness prioritized | Must be both fast and complete | Resource efficiency | Context-aware optimization |

### MindMeld™ Technical Requirements
The core application should be simple enough that students can make meaningful progress in 15-minute increments:

1. **Basic Functionality**
   - Simple Python application that takes user input ("thoughts")
   - Processes input according to an algorithm
   - Produces output that appears insightful

2. **Technical Components**
   - Input/output mechanism (console, web, or GUI depending on specification)
   - Simple NLP-like processing (keyword matching, sentiment analysis)
   - Storage mechanism (file, database, or cloud depending on specification)
   - "Algorithmic insight generation" (can be as simple as template responses)

3. **Evaluation Criteria**
   - Working prototype that demonstrates core functionality
   - Adaptation to changing requirements
   - Creative solutions to contradictory specifications
   - Team collaboration and role distribution

### Student Experience Management
The session should feel chaotic but remain psychologically safe:

1. **Maintaining Engagement**
   - Ensure frustration remains productive rather than discouraging
   - Provide moments of clarity and progress between contradictions
   - Recognize and praise creative solutions and diplomatic questioning

2. **Supporting Struggling Teams**
   - RED clearance assistants can provide subtle guidance if a team is completely stuck
   - Frame guidance as "The Algorithm has generously provided insight"
   - Ensure all teams can produce something for the final demonstration

3. **Managing Different Technical Levels**
   - Specifications should be implementable at various technical levels
   - Basic implementation should be achievable with fundamental Python skills
   - Advanced students can add sophisticated features that simplify handling contradictions

   - How did teams handle technical debt during rapid changes?
   - What would have made the codebase more resilient to specification changes?

3. **Professional Skill Development**
   - How did teams clarify requirements when faced with contradictions?
   - What communication strategies were effective with "management"?
   - How did teams maintain morale during seemingly arbitrary changes?

4. **Session Improvement**
   - Gather feedback on the session structure and pacing
   - Identify aspects that were most effective for learning
   - Collect suggestions for enhancing future sessions

## INSTRUCTOR NOTES

### Essential Atmospheric Elements
- Maintain corporate persona throughout the session
- Use corporate jargon consistently
- React to questions with doublespeak and circular logic
- Praise conformity while subtly encouraging creative solutions
- Create a sense of constant evaluation and surveillance

### Adjusting Difficulty
- For technical beginners: Provide more structured starter code
- For advanced students: Introduce additional technical constraints
- For larger classes: Add "interdepartmental collaboration requirements"
- For shorter sessions: Reduce to three 15-minute cycles

### Common Issues and Solutions
- **Students getting frustrated**: Provide moments of clarity and validation
- **Teams falling behind**: Offer "Algorithm-approved" templates to catch up
- **Teams refusing to adapt**: Introduce incentives for flexibility
- **Overachieving teams**: Add special "optimization challenges"

### Key Phrases for Instructors
- "The Algorithm appreciates your questioning. The answer is still no."
- "Your confusion is a natural step toward algorithmic enlightenment."
- "That's an interesting approach that The Algorithm will evaluate appropriately."
- "Your concerns have been noted in your permanent record."
- "The contradiction you perceive is merely your limited understanding of The Algorithm's vision."
