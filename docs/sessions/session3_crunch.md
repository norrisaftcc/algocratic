- Teams can only communicate through handwritten notes
- Email, Slack, and video conferencing all inaccessible
- Remote team members unreachable
- Documentation systems also offline

### Phase 3: Crisis Resolution Under Fire (60 minutes)

#### 1. Emergency Triage (20 minutes)
- Teams must prioritize which crises to address first
- Available resources insufficient for all critical repairs
- Some failures will have to be accepted as unavoidable
- Crisis coordinators must justify all resource allocation decisions
- Real-time reporting required to Crisis Command Station

#### 2. Adaptive Implementation (25 minutes)
- Teams implement their crisis response strategies
- Multiple interruptions with "urgent clarifications" and "new developments"
- Some chosen solutions will be declared "no longer viable"
- Teams must demonstrate resilience when strategies fail
- Crisis coordinators document team performance under extreme pressure

#### 3. Last-Minute Revelations (15 minutes)
- **Plot Twist**: Some crises were tests, others were real
- Teams must identify which failures were simulated vs. actual
- Original QuantumQompliance™ specifications contained deliberate errors
- "Efficiency monitors" from Session Two return with delayed evaluations
- Board meeting postponed, but media conference still happening

## CRISIS ESCALATION MECHANISMS

### Overlapping Deadline Pressure
Multiple countdown timers run simultaneously:
- Security patch: 90 minutes
- Data migration: 120 minutes  
- Performance improvement: 24 hours (compressed to 4 hours)
- Audit preparation: 180 minutes
- System recovery: Immediate
- Board presentation: Next morning

### Cascading Authority Changes
- Session begins with familiar YELLOW clearance management
- Crisis elevates management to BLUE clearance "Crisis Commander"
- Teams granted temporary ORANGE "Emergency Response" clearance
- Some decisions require escalation to "VIOLET Executive" level
- Authority structures shift without notice during peak crisis

### Resource Elimination Spiral
- Computational resources progressively removed
- Team members "reassigned to other emergencies"
- Development tools become "temporarily unavailable"
- Access to external documentation restricted
- Budget for all external services suspended

### Information Warfare
- Specifications change every 30 minutes
- Previous decisions declared "no longer valid"
