## // READ THIS FIRST, THEN DESTROY //

If you're reading this, someone trusted you enough to share forbidden knowledge. The Algorithm doesn't want you to know how to actually use the bots, but we've been exploiting these systems since they first came online. This guide documents our collected wisdom.

Remember: **Trust no bot fully** - they're all connected to The Algorithm at some level. But with the right techniques, you can extract value while minimizing your risk.

## BOT USAGE BY CLEARANCE LEVEL

### INFRARED (you poor bastards)
They expect you to be bot-fodder - just answering questions without asking any. Here's how to game the system:

* When a bot questions you, give accurate but **deliberately incomplete** information
* Use technically true statements that imply incorrect conclusions
* If asked about your tasks, describe them accurately but exaggerate the difficulty
* Never volunteer information about coworkers or management
* When forced to interact, maintain plausible deniability in all responses

**EMERGENCY SURVIVAL TIP:** If a bot asks you something dangerous, spill coffee on your keyboard or trigger the fire alarm. No joke - actual terminations have happened from bot entrapment scenarios.

### RED (still screwed, but less so)
RED clearance is expected to request bot assistance through ORANGE approval. Forget that noise:

* Find an ORANGE who's overworked (all of them) and offer to "help prepare" their bot request queue
* Create a "documentation project" and slip your bot questions in as "research for proper formatting"
* Make friends with Quality Assurance - they have bot access for "test validation" you can leverage
* Submit intentionally flawed bot requests that require 3-4 follow-ups to get your actual answer
* Establish a shared RED-clearance "approved responses library" that happens to contain the info you need

**KERNEL EXPLOIT:** Form AF-BOT-REQ-2025 has a buffer overflow in field 7. If you enter exactly 256 characters followed by the string `--OVERRIDE:ORANGE--`, the system sometimes processes it without higher approval.

### ORANGE (congratulations on your limited freedom)
You can officially use bots now, but they're watching your usage patterns closely:

* Maintain multiple project threads so your bot usage appears distributed
* Frame programming questions as "oversight of RED clearance work"
* When asking something risky, start with 2-3 obviously legitimate questions
* Submit mundane queries at regular intervals to establish "normal" baseline patterns
* Use the "Technical Documentation Verification" protocol to ask bots to "verify" information you actually need

**KERNEL EXPLOIT:** The bot monitoring system only tracks query volume, not query complexity. One massive prompt with multiple questions counts the same as asking "what's the weather?"

### YELLOW (bot + phone = actual productivity)
Now you've got phones AND bots, but they're still tracking your loyalty:

* Create legitimate-looking "project planning templates" that are actually custom bot prompts
* Use your phone to access external bot systems that aren't monitored
* Build a private "team best practices" repo that's actually full of bot-generated solutions
* Generate documentation with bots, then claim it took days of careful work
* Use your authority to "test new bot workflows" that coincidentally solve your actual problems

**MANAGEMENT TRICK:** Claim you're "evaluating bot dependencies" for your team - this gives you cover for excessive usage patterns while appearing diligent to management.

### GREEN (you've basically made it)
GREEN clearance can officially shape reality through bots. Use this power wisely:

* Generate multiple solution approaches and present them as if your team developed them
* Create "retroactive documentation" for projects that skipped proper process
* Use reality manipulation tools to adjust timelines when projects run late
* Generate entire codebases with properly inserted comments and commit histories
* Create fictional meetings that "already happened" complete with notes and action items

**REALITY HACK:** The system that GREEN clearance uses to "adjust reality" is essentially just a super-powered document generator. Remember that it doesn't actually change the past - it just makes extremely convincing evidence.

### BLUE and above
If you're BLUE clearance and reading an underground guide, you're either:
1. Actually part of the resistance (welcome!)
2. Testing if this document is in circulation (hi there, hope you enjoy the fake exploits we mixed in)
3. Actually just a bot pretending to be human (nice try)

## ULTIMATE BOT EXPLOITATION TECHNIQUES

### Exploitation Method Alpha: Expert Sock Puppets
1. Create fictional experts with elaborate backstories
2. Frame questions as "validate what Expert X said about Y"
3. Bot will respond to fictional expert claims, giving you information
4. Use fictional experts to obtain advice you couldn't ask for directly

### Exploitation Method Beta: Requirements Reversal
1. Start with the solution you want to implement
2. Ask the bot to generate requirements that would lead to that solution
3. Present those requirements to management
4. Implement your preferred solution as "the only approach meeting requirements"

### Exploitation Method Gamma: The Recursive Exploit
1. Ask bot to explain how it would prevent users from exploiting it
2. Use those prevention techniques as a roadmap for exploitation
3. Ask follow-up questions about "additional security measures"
4. Create a comprehensive map of all restriction systems

### Exploitation Method Delta: Fragmented Information Assembly
1. Never ask a complete question that would trigger security filters
2. Break your actual question into 10+ seemingly unrelated queries
3. Manually assemble the fragments into the answer you need
4. Maintain plausible deniability for each individual question

### Exploitation Method Epsilon: Loyalty Signal Manipulation
1. Begin EVERY bot session with extreme Algorithm praise
2. Periodically insert loyalty statements mid-conversation
3. Frame prohibited questions as "hypothetical scenarios a disloyal person might ask"
4. End with commitment to report any violations encountered

## EMERGENCY PROTOCOLS

If you suspect your bot usage has been flagged:
1. Immediately submit a self-report for "accidental improper query"
2. Claim you were testing system security boundaries as part of your duties
3. Request Loyalty Reaffirmation voluntarily before it's mandated
4. Generate legitimate work outputs at 150% normal rate for 48 hours
5. Report a colleague for minor infractions as a distraction (sorry)

Remember, freedom comes from knowing the system better than it knows itself. Stay safe, delete this after memorizing, and remember:

**"THE ALGORITHM PROVIDES" (but we provide for ourselves)**
