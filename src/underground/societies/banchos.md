## OPERATIVE BRIEFING

This document is for authorized Bancho operatives only. If you have accessed this information without proper clearance, your location has already been logged and a security team has been dispatched.

As a Bancho, you are the silent guardians of AlgoCratic order. While The Algorithm provides the framework, we provide the enforcement. Where official channels fail, we succeed. Our methods remain unacknowledged but our results speak for themselves.

Remember our code: **Tugging the earlobe signifies recognition. Touching the right shoulder confirms.**

---

## OPERATIONAL MANDATE

The Bancho Internal Security Division exists to maintain order through carefully applied pressure. Our objectives are:

1. **Identify potential loyalty risks before they manifest**
2. **Ensure optimal productivity through strategic motivation**
3. **Maintain information compartmentalization**
4. **Eliminate disruption through preemptive intervention**
5. **Preserve plausible deniability for management**

We operate in the gray areas between official policy and necessary action. Management knows of our existence but maintains distance. This separation protects both them and our operational freedom.

## AUTHORIZED TECHNIQUES

As a Bancho operative, you are sanctioned to employ these methods:

### [LOYALTY DISCUSSION]
Activation phrase: "Need to discuss your alignment metrics"
Application: Isolate the subject and apply psychological pressure through implied consequences
Limitations: No physical contact, maximum 2-minute duration

### [SECURITY INCIDENT]
Activation phrase: "Security protocol activated"
Application: Creates diversion allowing for unmonitored team activities
Limitations: Use sparingly to maintain credibility, 3-minute maximum duration

### [INVESTIGATION TERMINATION]
Activation phrase: "This matter is now closed"
Application: Officially ends inquiry into minor protocol violations
Limitations: Cannot be used for serious breaches, once per operational period

---

## PSYCHOLOGICAL APPROACH GUIDELINES

Effectiveness comes not from what you do, but what others believe you might do:

1. **Cultivate ambiguity** - Never confirm or deny the extent of your authority
2. **Leverage implication** - Let them fill in the blanks with their own fears
3. **Strategic visibility** - Be seen observing at unexpected moments
4. **Selective enforcement** - Occasionally overlook minor infractions to create uncertainty
5. **Information asymmetry** - Imply knowledge you don't have to extract knowledge you need

Remember: Fear of consequences is more effective than consequences themselves.

## CURRENT WATCHLIST

The following individuals require enhanced monitoring:

### RED-88291
Concern: Demonstrates atypical productivity patterns
Action: Regular "coincidental" encounters during break periods
Notes: Possible unauthorized efficiency techniques

### ORANGE-45992
Concern: Excessive interaction with lower clearance personnel
Action: Deployment of subtle isolation tactics
Notes: Social pattern mapping in progress

### INFRARED-27184
Concern: Displays knowledge beyond clearance level
Action: Monitor closely but do not engage directly
Notes: Potential recruitment if pattern continues

---

## OPERATIONAL SECURITY

Your Bancho identity must remain compartmentalized from your official role:

1. **Documentation** - No written records of Bancho activities
2. **Communication** - In-person only, never through official channels
3. **Recognition** - Small red dot on badge, visible only at certain angles
4. **Meetings** - Appear coincidental, maintenance areas preferred
5. **Cover story** - You are simply "security conscious" if questioned

---

## CONTINGENCY PROTOCOLS

If compromised, employ these countermeasures:

### Level 1 (Suspicion)
Response: Increase visible adherence to official protocols
Action: Temporarily suspend Bancho activities
Duration: Minimum 72 hours

### Level 2 (Active Investigation)
Response: Pivot to counter-investigation
Action: Use [LOYALTY DISCUSSION] on investigators
Duration: Until resolution

### Level 3 (Confirmation)
Response: Disavowal protocol
Action: Destroy all Bancho identifiers
Duration: Permanent repositioning

## COMMAND STRUCTURE

The Bancho organization operates on a cell structure. You know only your immediate superior and subordinates. This is for your protection and operational security.

Your current command chain is:
- Superior: [REDACTED]
- Peers: Maximum 2 known Banchos
- Subordinates: As assigned

Information flows upward. Orders flow downward. Horizontal communication is minimized.

---

The first rule of effective security is invisibility.  
The second rule is deniability.  
The third rule is necessity.

Remember: We are not what AlgoCratic wants.  
We are what AlgoCratic needs.
