## AUTHORIZED COMMUNICATION CHANNELS

As a RED clearance Junior Innovation Contributor, you have been granted expanded communication privileges. These protocols must be strictly observed:

### Approved Communication Methods:

* **Dedicated Project Channels** - You may now initiate discussions in designated project channels
* **Technical Documentation Comments** - You may add comments to technical documentation (with approval)
* **Issue Tracking System** - You may create and respond to tickets within your assigned domain
* **Direct Communication with Fellow RED Personnel** - You may initiate conversations with other RED clearance staff
* **Upward Communication to ORANGE Clearance** - You may respond to ORANGE clearance inquiries directly
* **Code Review Comments** - You may provide feedback on code submitted for review

### Communication Etiquette Protocols:

1. All communication must be preceded by your RED clearance identifier
2. Technical focus must be maintained at all times
3. Emotional expressions must be limited to Algorithm-approved sentiments
4. Messages should be concise, specific, and action-oriented
5. Subject lines must follow the standardized classification format

> **ATTENTION:** All communication channels are continuously monitored for compliance. Deviation from approved technical topics will trigger automatic loyalty assessment. Remember: Work-related communications only.

### Communication Templates:

#### Standard Inquiry Format:
```
[RED-<ID>] Technical Inquiry: <Subject>
Context: <Background Information>
Specific Question: <Clear, Specific Question>
Attempted Solutions: <List of At Least Two Approaches Already Tried>
```

#### Status Report Format:
```
[RED-<ID>] Status Report: <Project Code>
Completed Tasks: <List of Completed Items>
Blockers: <List of Obstacles, If Any>
Next Actions: <What You Will Do Next>
Resources Required: <Additional Resources Needed, If Any>
```

> **SURVIVAL TIP:** When communicating with ORANGE clearance personnel, it is advisable to prepare your questions in advance and batch them when possible. Each communication is evaluated for relevance and necessity. Non-essential communications reflect poorly on efficiency metrics.

### Prohibited Communication:

* Discussion of personnel matters
* Sharing of technical information with INFRARED resources without approval
* Any communication regarding project timelines or deadlines
* Discussion of system architecture or design decisions
* Communication with YELLOW clearance or above without prior authorization
* Any form of social, non-work-related discussion

### Multi-Contributor Communication Protocol:

When assigned to a multi-contributor project, all technical discussions must occur in the designated project channel. Direct messages should be limited to clarification of specific implementation details only. Remember that one-on-one communications are subject to the same monitoring as public channels.
