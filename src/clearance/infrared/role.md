## YOUR ROLE

As an INFRARED clearance Probationary Resource Unit, you exist at the lowest functional level of the AlgoCratic Futuresâ„¢ hierarchy. Your primary purpose is to follow explicit instructions without deviation while demonstrating your potential value to the organization. Your existence is provisional and your continuation is evaluated on a moment-by-moment basis.

Your designation grants you the following privileges:

* Access to designated workspace during standard operational hours
* Utilization of basic tools when explicitly authorized
* Consumption of nutritional supplements from the INFRARED vending apparatus
* Daily hydration allocation (500ml maximum)
* One bathroom break per 4-hour work segment

> **ATTENTION:** Reminder: INFRARED clearance is a probationary status. Your behavior, productivity, and loyalty are continuously monitored. Advancement to RED clearance is contingent upon satisfactory performance metrics.
