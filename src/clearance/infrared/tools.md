## BASIC TOOL UTILIZATION

INFRARED resources are permitted limited access to the following tools:

* Text editors (read-only mode unless explicitly granted write permission)
* Version control system (view-only access to designated repositories)
* INFRARED documentation portal
* Basic command line operations (pre-approved commands only)
* Tutorial environments (sandboxed)

> **SURVIVAL TIP:** Master the basic tools thoroughly before attempting to demonstrate more advanced skills. Solid fundamentals will accelerate your clearance elevation timeline.

**Approved Command List for INFRARED Personnel:**

* `ls` - List files in current directory
* `cd` - Change directory (within approved zones only)
* `cat` - Display file contents (read-only)
* `git clone` - Clone repository (approved repositories only)
* `git status` - Check status of local repository
* `git pull` - Update local repository from remote
* `python filename.py` - Run Python scripts (approved files only)

> **ATTENTION:** Any attempt to use commands not on this list will be logged and may result in immediate termination. If you require additional capabilities, submit form AF-TOOL-REQ-2025 to your RED clearance supervisor.

> **ATTENTION: COMMUNICATION DEVICES RESTRICTION:** INFRARED resources are not permitted to access personal communication devices (including mobile terminals and communication units) during operational hours. These devices are restricted to YELLOW clearance and above. Unauthorized device usage will be detected by The Algorithm and result in loyalty score reduction.
