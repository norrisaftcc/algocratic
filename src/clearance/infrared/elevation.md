## PATHWAY TO RED CLEARANCE

INFRARED status is designed to be temporary. Your elevation to RED clearance depends on demonstrating the following:

* Consistent compliance with all INFRARED protocols
* Mastery of basic tool utilization
* Successful completion of assigned tutorial modules
* Ability to understand and follow technical instructions
* Positive evaluation from at least two RED clearance supervisors
* Passing score on the RED Clearance Qualification Examination

The standard elevation timeline is 2-4 weeks, though exceptional performers may accelerate this process.

> **ATTENTION:** Resources remaining at INFRARED clearance beyond 6 weeks will be subject to comprehensive re-evaluation and potential reassignment to Maintenance Services Division.

**RED Clearance Benefits:**

* Authorization to modify designated code repositories
* Access to expanded command set
* Permission to initiate communication with ORANGE clearance personnel
* Eligibility for assignment to project teams
* Increased nutritional supplement allocation
* Authorized use of writing implements

> **SURVIVAL TIP:** While advancement is desirable, remember that higher clearance brings increased scrutiny and responsibility. Ensure you are truly prepared before seeking evaluation for clearance elevation.
