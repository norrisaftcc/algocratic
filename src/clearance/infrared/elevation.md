## PATHWAY TO RED CLEARANCE

INFRARED status is designed to be temporary. Your elevation to RED clearance depends on demonstrating the following:

* Consistent compliance with all INFRARED protocols
* Mastery of basic tool utilization
* Successful completion of assigned tutorial modules
* Ability to understand and follow technical instructions
* Positive evaluation from at least two RED clearance supervisors
* Passing score on the RED Clearance Qualification Examination

The standard elevation timeline is 2-4 weeks, though exceptional performers may accelerate this process.

> **ATTENTION:** Resources remaining at INFRARED clearance beyond 6 weeks will be subject to comprehensive re-evaluation and potential reassignment to Maintenance Services Division.

### Alternative Elevation Pathways

While standard elevation follows the criteria above, The Algorithm recognizes that valuable contributions can manifest through multiple approaches. Resource units who demonstrate EXCEPTIONAL CAPABILITIES in one or more of the following areas may qualify for accelerated elevation through Alternative Pathway Protocol 11-C:

1. **Productivity Enhancement:** Documented implementation of process improvements resulting in efficiency gains exceeding 15%
2. **Problem Resolution:** Successfully addressing a Critical or High-severity operational issue
3. **Knowledge Synthesis:** Creating documentation that clarifies complex systems for other resource units
4. **Resource Optimization:** Identifying and implementing resource conservation measures
5. **Error Prevention:** Developing validation processes that prevent potential system failures

To apply for alternative elevation consideration, complete Alternative Evaluation Request Form IR-94B with comprehensive documentation of your contributions.

Note: The Alternative Pathway Protocol is not widely advertised due to resource allocation constraints. Resource units who independently DISCOVER this option demonstrate the initiative qualities valued by The Algorithm.

**RED Clearance Benefits:**

* Authorization to modify designated code repositories
* Access to expanded command set
* Permission to initiate communication with ORANGE clearance personnel
* Eligibility for assignment to project teams
* Increased nutritional supplement allocation
* Authorized use of writing implements

> **SURVIVAL TIP:** While advancement is desirable, remember that higher clearance brings increased scrutiny and responsibility. Ensure you are truly prepared before seeking evaluation for clearance elevation.

### Clearance Evaluation Scheduling

Standard evaluation scheduling occurs through your assigned RED clearance supervisor. However, when justified by operational requirements, resource units may initiate evaluation scheduling through the following procedure:

1. Document at least three completed assignments demonstrating RED clearance capabilities
2. Complete Self-Evaluation Form IR-CE-21 
3. Obtain peer endorsement from at least one fellow INFRARED resource
4. Submit completed documentation to department scheduling coordinator

While direct clearance evaluation requests are not officially encouraged, resource units who demonstrate appropriate SELF-ASSESSMENT capabilities often receive positive evaluation consideration. Remember that premature evaluation requests can negatively impact your advancement profile, but appropriate initiative is valued by The Algorithm.
