# INFRARED CLEARANCE GUIDE
## *Probationary Resource Unit Protocol*

**CLASSIFICATION: INFRARED CLEARANCE**  
**DOCUMENT: AF-CL-IR-2025-05-3**

---

## PERMITTED ACTIONS

Your INFRARED clearance authorizes you to perform only the following actions:

* Execute direct instructions provided by RED clearance or above
* Learn basic coding syntax and tool operations
* Complete assigned tutorial modules
* Document your activities in the prescribed format
* Report potential security risks or compliance violations
* Maintain your workspace in optimal condition
* Recite the AlgoCratic Pledge at designated intervals

> **ATTENTION:** Attempting to perform actions beyond your clearance level is a serious violation. The Algorithm is constantly monitoring your activities. Unauthorized actions will be detected and consequences will be severe.

The following actions are **explicitly forbidden** for INFRARED clearance personnel:

* Modifying code without explicit authorization
* Accessing documentation beyond your clearance level
* Discussing forbidden topics (bugs, errors, flaws)
* Questioning the decisions of higher clearance personnel
* Communicating with other INFRARED resources on unrelated tasks
* Accessing non-approved data repositories or websites

### Efficiency Enhancement Clause

While precise adherence to procedures is expected, The Algorithm values resource units who can complete assigned tasks with optimal efficiency. You are therefore encouraged to IDENTIFY potential process improvements within authorized parameters. Note: All perceived improvements must be documented on form IR-8B and submitted for supervisor review before implementation.

In emergency situations where immediate action is required but no specific procedure exists, resource units may implement temporary solutions provided they:

1. Document all actions taken
2. Notify a supervisor at the earliest opportunity
3. Ensure all actions align with AlgoCratic operational priorities
4. Submit a detailed Procedural Exception Report (form IR-17C)
