## SURVIVING YOUR FIRST ASSIGNMENTS

Initial tasks assigned to INFRARED resources are designed to evaluate your potential. Follow these guidelines to maximize your survival probability:

* Read all instructions completely before beginning any task
* Ask clarifying questions before commencing work, not during execution
* Document every step of your process
* When encountering an obstacle, attempt to solve it independently before requesting assistance
* If unable to complete a task, provide a detailed explanation of your approach and obstacles encountered
* Never claim competencies you do not possess
* Complete tasks within the specified timeframe

> **SURVIVAL TIP:** The Algorithm values both accuracy and efficiency. A correct solution delivered late is still a failure. An incorrect solution delivered on time is also a failure. Manage your time accordingly.

**Assignment Structure:**

INFRARED assignments typically follow this structure:

* **Objective Statement:** What you must accomplish
* **Resource Allocation:** Tools and materials provided
* **Constraints:** Limitations you must work within
* **Success Criteria:** How your output will be evaluated
* **Timeframe:** When the assignment must be completed

> **ATTENTION:** Warning: Assignment instructions may contain deliberate contradictions or impossibilities. These are not errors. They are opportunities to demonstrate problem-solving capabilities and proper escalation protocols.
