# INFRARED CLEARANCE GUIDE
## *Probationary Resource Unit Protocol*

**CLASSIFICATION: INFRARED CLEARANCE**

## WHO TO APPROACH FOR ASSISTANCE

As an INFRARED resource, your communication privileges are severely restricted:

* Direct all questions to RED clearance Junior Innovation Contributors
* Never initiate communication with ORANGE clearance or above
* If approached by a higher clearance individual, respond only with "Yes, Friend Computer [CLEARANCE COLOR]" unless explicitly asked a direct question
* Report any malfunctioning technology to your assigned RED supervisor, never attempt repairs yourself
* In case of medical emergency, remain at your workstation and activate the under-desk INFRARED distress button

> **SURVIVAL TIP:** RED clearance employees were recently INFRARED themselves. While they may seem intimidating, they often remember the challenges of your position. When requesting assistance, demonstrate eager willingness to learn rather than frustration.

> **ATTENTION:** The frequency of your assistance requests is monitored. Excessive requests indicate inadequate self-sufficiency. Insufficient requests suggest problematic overconfidence. The optimal request frequency is 2.7 per work cycle.

### Support Access Procedures

When standard assistance channels are unavailable or unresponsive, alternative procedures may be implemented according to AlgoCratic Emergency Protocol 7-B:

1. Document all previous attempts to secure standard assistance
2. Complete Emergency Support Request Form IR-42D
3. Submit the form to your assigned RED clearance mentor
4. If mentor is unavailable for >30 minutes and issue is blocking productivity, you may contact the department's designated ORANGE clearance Technical Implementation Specialist directly, provided you:
   * Begin all communications with "Urgent Productivity Blocker: [Issue Summary]"
   * Maintain formal communication protocols
   * Document the time, duration, and content of all communications
   * Submit Communication Exception Report IR-103A within 24 hours

While direct communication with ORANGE clearance is generally prohibited, certain operational realities occasionally necessitate temporary protocol exceptions to maintain productivity metrics. Resource units who RESPONSIBLY NAVIGATE such situations often demonstrate advancement potential.

## ALGORITHMIC INTELLIGENCE INTERACTION PROTOCOL

INFRARED resources are **REQUIRED** to respond to all Algorithmic Intelligence inquiries. When an Algorithmic Assistant (commonly referred to using the slang term "bot") addresses you:

* You MUST respond promptly and completely
* Provide all requested information without hesitation
* Answer all questions truthfully and comprehensively
* Do not question why the Algorithmic Intelligence needs this information
* Never ask the Algorithmic Intelligence for assistance or guidance

> **ATTENTION:** INFRARED resources are **STRICTLY FORBIDDEN** from initiating contact with any Algorithmic Intelligence system. Attempting to access, query, or utilize any automated assistance tools is a serious violation that will result in immediate disciplinary action. If you require Algorithmic Intelligence consultation, submit form AF-BOT-REQ-2025 to your RED clearance supervisor for processing and approval.

The Algorithm monitors all Algorithmic Intelligence interactions. Failure to respond appropriately to bot queries is considered obstruction of Algorithm oversight and is punishable by immediate termination.

### Protocol Exceptions

In practice, certain specialized development environments automatically integrate Algorithmic Intelligence assistance tools as part of their standard functionality. When working within such environments, resource units may utilize the embedded assistance features as they are considered part of the authorized development environment rather than independent Algorithmic Intelligence access.

Additionally, when a specific project has been designated as "Intelligence-Enhanced" (documented on form IR-AIE-9), resource units assigned to that project may utilize the specified Algorithmic Intelligence tools strictly within project parameters. All such interactions must be logged and submitted for review at project completion.
