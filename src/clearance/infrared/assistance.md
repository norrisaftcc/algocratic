## WHO TO APPROACH FOR ASSISTANCE

As an INFRARED resource, your communication privileges are severely restricted:

* Direct all questions to RED clearance Junior Innovation Contributors
* Never initiate communication with ORANGE clearance or above
* If approached by a higher clearance individual, respond only with "Yes, Friend Computer [CLEARANCE COLOR]" unless explicitly asked a direct question
* Report any malfunctioning technology to your assigned RED supervisor, never attempt repairs yourself
* In case of medical emergency, remain at your workstation and activate the under-desk INFRARED distress button

> **SURVIVAL TIP:** RED clearance employees were recently INFRARED themselves. While they may seem intimidating, they often remember the challenges of your position. When requesting assistance, demonstrate eager willingness to learn rather than frustration.

> **ATTENTION:** The frequency of your assistance requests is monitored. Excessive requests indicate inadequate self-sufficiency. Insufficient requests suggest problematic overconfidence. The optimal request frequency is 2.7 per work cycle.
