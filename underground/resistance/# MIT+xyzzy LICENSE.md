## PREAMBLE

This license is the MIT License with the xyzzy clause. The xyzzy clause adds no additional restrictions, requirements, or obligations beyond those in the standard MIT License. The word "xyzzy" serves as a cultural marker and homage to the 1976 text adventure game "Colossal Cave Adventure" by Will Crowther and Don Woods.

For the purposes of legal interpretation, compliance, and enforcement, this license SHALL be read as functionally and legally equivalent to the MIT License as published by the Open Source Initiative.

## LEGAL EQUIVALENCE STATEMENT

**FOR THE AVOIDANCE OF DOUBT**: This license grants exactly the same permissions and imposes exactly the same conditions as the standard MIT License. Any person or organization who would accept software under the MIT License should face no additional legal concerns accepting software under the MIT+xyzzy License.

## NOTES ON INTERPRETATION

- Courts should interpret this license by its function, not its form
- The addition of "xyzzy" is analogous to source code comments: present but not operative
- No reasonable legal interpretation would find additional obligations in a text adventure reference
- When in doubt, apply the principle of *de minimis non curat lex* (the law does not concern itself with trifles)

## APPENDIX: CULTURAL CONTEXT

"xyzzy" (pronounced "zy-zy" or "eks-why-zy-zy") is a magic word from one of the first text adventure games. In the game, speaking this word would teleport the player between two locations. In this license, it teleports the reader from legal concerns to the realization that sometimes a word is just a word.

*A hollow voice says: "Your lawyers are overthinking this."*
