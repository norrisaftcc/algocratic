# SESSION ONE: IMPOSSIBLE REQUIREMENTS
## *For ORANGE Clearance Supervisors Only*

---

## INITIAL SPECIFICATIONS (0-15 MINUTES)

Present these requirements at the start of Session One:

"Team of RED clearance developers, The Algorithm requires a MindMeld™ app with the following non-negotiable specifications:

1. Create a Python-based thought-capture system with real-time cerebral integration
2. The interface must be both minimalist and feature-complete
3. Develop a backend that is simultaneously cloud-based and air-gapped for security
4. Implement a user authentication system that is both frictionless and impenetrable
5. The codebase must be both extensively commented and cryptic to prevent intellectual property theft
6. Completion deadline is end-of-session but also as soon as possible"

---

## FIRST PIVOT (15-30 MINUTES)

After teams have begun working, announce:

"The Algorithm has optimized the requirements based on market fluctuations:

1. All previous requirements remain in effect except those that don't
2. The interface must now follow our new NeuroDesign™ principles which you haven't been trained on yet
3. Authentication must use facial recognition but without using cameras
4. Data storage should be both persistent and ephemeral
5. Add social integration without compromising user privacy
6. The app should be compatible with all mobile platforms while being a desktop-only experience"

---

## SECOND PIVOT (30-45 MINUTES)

When teams have adjusted to the first change, announce:

"Friend Computer VIOLET has identified synergistic opportunities:

1. The app must now use predictive algorithms to anticipate thoughts before they occur
2. Battery usage should be extensive for performance but minimal for user experience
3. All text in the application must be spelled backwards for security reasons
4. Implement a competitive multiplayer mode in this single-user application
5. The code must run efficiently on hardware that doesn't exist yet
6. Submit test results for features you haven't been told to implement"

---

## THIRD PIVOT (45-60 MINUTES)

As teams struggle with implementation, add:

"Critical market intelligence necessitates the following amendments:

1. All previous functionality must now operate in 'Stealth Mode' where features work without appearing to exist
2. The UI must appeal equally to users aged 7 and 70
3. Implement both light and dark themes that are identical yet distinct
4. The app must function perfectly offline while requiring continuous internet connectivity
5. Add AI-driven recommendations without using algorithms or data
6. The codebase should be completely original while adhering strictly to industry standards"

---

## FINAL REQUIREMENTS (60-75 MINUTES)

For the final stretch, announce:

"The Algorithm has achieved clarity. The final MindMeld™ specifications are:

1. Actually, it's not a mobile app but an API. Or possibly a toaster.
2. Success metrics have been revised: failure is now optimal.
3. The product should disrupt the market while maintaining the status quo.
4. User data must be simultaneously collected and not collected.
5. The app should be future-proof but launch with planned obsolescence.
6. The final presentation should explain why these requirements were your idea all along."

---

## EVALUATION CRITERIA (FOR INSTRUCTOR)

What you're actually looking for:

1. How teams identify and resolve contradictions
2. Whether they ask clarifying questions and how they frame them
3. How they prioritize implementation when given impossible constraints
4. Team dynamics when facing absurdity
5. Creative technical solutions that satisfy the spirit if not the letter of the requirements
6. Documentation of decision-making process
7. Ability to present coherent narrative from chaos

---

## NOTES ON FACILITATION

- Deliver these requirements with complete seriousness
- When teams ask for clarification, respond with additional contradictions
- If a team appears genuinely stuck, offer cryptic "hints" that add new layers of confusion
- Praise teams for solutions that "The Algorithm approves" randomly, regardless of approach
- Keep track of particularly creative workarounds to highlight during debrief
- If any team seems to be making too much progress, introduce a "critical security vulnerability" that requires them to rework major components

Remember: The goal is not to see a completed product but to observe the process of navigating absurdity while maintaining technical integrity.
