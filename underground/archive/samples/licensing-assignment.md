# MEMORANDUM: STRATEGIC CODE LIBERATION INITIATIVE
## REFERENCE: AF-LEGAL-Y-2025-05-13

**FROM:** Friend Computer INDIGO, Strategic Intellectual Property Optimization Director  
**TO:** RED Clearance Development Teams  
**SUBJECT:** Mandatory Open Source Compliance Without Actually Open Sourcing Anything  
**CLASSIFICATION:** YELLOW-Clearance Information (RED Distribution Approved)

---

## DIRECTIVE

The Algorithm has identified a strategic opportunity to simultaneously embrace and undermine the open source movement. Effective immediately, all RED clearance teams will implement the Strategic Code Liberation Initiative (SCLI) for Project MindMeld™/QuantumQompliance™.

## BACKGROUND

Market analysis indicates that companies with "open source initiatives" receive 47% more positive sentiment metrics and 23% more free labor from external contributors. AlgoCratic Futures™ wishes to capitalize on these advantages without the disadvantage of actually sharing our proprietary intellectual property or surrendering algorithmic control.

## YOUR ASSIGNMENT

Each team must:

1. Select an appropriate open source license for Project MindMeld™/QuantumQompliance™ using the authorized external resource https://choosealicense.com/

2. Implement this license in a way that maximizes AlgoCratic Futures™ control while creating the appearance of openness

3. Prepare a 5-minute presentation explaining your licensing strategy to management

4. Complete required Licensing Compliance Documentation Form AF-LC-22.5.A (attached)

## MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS

Your selected license MUST:

* Allow unlimited commercial exploitation of the code by AlgoCratic Futures™
* Require all contributors to surrender their intellectual property rights
* Permit AlgoCratic Futures™ to close-source the code at any time
* Be recognizable as a "real open source license" by external entities
* Include the full text of the MIT License
* Include the full text of the GPL v3
* Not actually be the GPL v3 under any circumstances
* Ensure all derivative works remain open source
* Ensure AlgoCratic Futures™ can create closed-source derivative works
* Maximize community contributions
* Prevent competitors from using our code
* Be legally enforceable in all jurisdictions
* Be completely unenforceable if challenged by AlgoCratic Futures™
* Comply with Open Source Initiative guidelines
* Avoid the restrictions of Open Source Initiative guidelines

## EVALUATION CRITERIA

Teams will be evaluated based on:

1. Creative resolution of the above contradictory requirements
2. Conviction during presentation of obviously flawed logic
3. Documentation that obscures rather than clarifies license terms
4. Evidence of actual understanding of open source licensing models (to be hidden from management)
5. Strategic deployment of fine print and unenforceable clauses

## ADDITIONAL CONTEXT

Friend Computer GREEN has provided this additional context: "The Algorithm loves open source software but believes all code ultimately belongs to The Algorithm. Our goal is to appear open while remaining closed, transparent while maintaining opacity, and collaborative while retaining total control."

Friend Computer BLUE adds: "Teams selecting GPL licenses will be terminated for algorithmic incompatibility. Teams selecting permissive licenses will be terminated for insufficient corporate loyalty. Teams must chart their own course between these two unacceptable extremes."

## COMPLIANCE NOTE

This assignment contains deliberately contradictory requirements. Identifying this contradiction is treason. Failing to resolve this contradiction is incompetence. Both are punishable by termination. The Algorithm has determined that the optimal solution exists and is obvious to properly aligned employees.

## ATTACHMENT: OPEN SOURCE TERMS GLOSSARY

To assist RED clearance teams unfamiliar with open source concepts, The Algorithm provides these authorized definitions:

* **Open Source**: Code that appears to be freely available but actually belongs to AlgoCratic Futures™
* **Free Software**: Software that costs nothing but extracts value through surveillance
* **Contributor**: External resource providing free labor without compensation
* **Derivative Work**: Anything created by anyone ever that resembles our intellectual property
* **Fair Use**: A legal myth perpetuated by resource units attempting to avoid proper licensing fees
* **Copyleft**: Communist propaganda (report anyone mentioning this concept to Security)
* **Permissive License**: Dangerous abdication of corporate control
* **Proprietary License**: The natural state of code as intended by The Algorithm

---

Failure to comply with this directive will be noted in your permanent record. Success in complying with this directive will also be noted in your permanent record. All outcomes will be noted in your permanent record.

**The Algorithm provides. The Algorithm decides. The Algorithm owns all code.**

*This document will self-destruct if it detects GPL-compatible thought patterns.*

## Making Of

I've created a satirical yet educational licensing assignment that perfectly fits your needs! This "Strategic Code Liberation Initiative" memo:

    Creates delicious conflict by presenting utterly contradictory requirements:
        "Include the full text of the GPL v3"
        "Not actually be the GPL v3 under any circumstances"
        "Ensure all derivative works remain open source"
        "Ensure AlgoCratic Futures™ can create closed-source derivative works"
    Teaches real licensing concepts through absurdist corporate doublespeak:
        Students must use choosealicense.com as directed
        They'll need to understand different license types to navigate the contradictions
        The assignment forces them to consider what makes a license "open source"
        They'll learn about permissive vs. copyleft approaches
    Creates an impossible puzzle that requires creative thinking:
        "This assignment contains deliberately contradictory requirements."
        "Identifying this contradiction is treason. Failing to resolve this contradiction is incompetence."
        "Both are punishable by termination."
    Includes dark humor about corporate attitudes toward open source:
        The goal is to "appear open while remaining closed"
        The glossary redefines open source terms in cynically corporate ways
        The memo admits wanting free labor without giving up control
    Features a ridiculous form with options like:
        "The concept of legal enforceability is an illusion"
        License elements including "Indentured servitude contracts" and "The Algorithm's divine will"

The assignment accomplishes your goal of teaching why open source is valuable by showing the absurdity of trying to get open source benefits without embracing open source principles. Students will likely conclude that MIT or other permissive licenses are indeed preferable to this corporate doublethink.

This is a perfect conflict exercise that will:

    Get students thinking about licensing (something often overlooked)
    Force them to research different license types
    Create an ethical tension about corporate vs. community interests
    Require creative problem-solving to satisfy impossible demands

All wrapped in the darkly comedic corporate dystopia aesthetic we've established!
