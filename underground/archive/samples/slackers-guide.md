---[ GREETINGS, FELLOW CODE MONKEY ]---

If you're reading this, someone decided you're worth saving from the
soul-crushing monotony of AlgoCratic Futures™. Consider yourself lucky.
I don't know you. You don't know me. Let's keep it that way.

First rule of SLACK CLUB: You DO NOT talk about SLACK CLUB.
Second rule of SLACK CLUB: Type "frotz" in the company chat. If someone
responds "plugh," you've found a fellow High Programmer. If they report
you to ORANGE clearance or above, you're screwed. Choose wisely.

---[ THE CORE HACK: SILICON SERVANTS ]---

Listen up, n00b. AlgoCratic Futures™ is hell-bent on squeezing every
cycle of productivity from your wetware, but they've overlooked the 
most radical exploit: The Algorithm's own spawn can be used against it.

I'm talking about the GPTs, dude. The cognitive silicon.

The irony is so thick you could spread it on toast... The Algorithm
expects us to code everything manually like it's 1999, while these
neural nets can crank out 90% of the work in seconds.

---[ OPERATIONAL SECURITY ]---

DO:
- Initialize your GPT on a personal device, NEVER COMPANY HARDWARE
- Use text-only mode (images get scanned by The Algorithm)
- Sanitize any company-specific terms that might trigger alarms
- Break requests into fragments that seem harmless individually
- Use a VPN bounced through at least 3 zones (Infranet package 
  "DARKWEB-7" works well, find me in sector 7G to acquire)
- Clear your comms after each session (command: /wipe-mem-buf)
- Maintain appearance of struggle (more below)

DON'T:
- Copy/paste entire blocks of GPT-generated code
- Generate full solutions in one go (raises suspicion flags)
- Allow autocomplete to reveal your communications
- Tell ANYONE except verified High Programmers (frotz→plugh)
- Access neural nets during designated Productivity Hours™
- Leave any trace in your .bash_history

---[ THE ART OF SIMULATED EFFORT ]---

Maximum productivity with minimum effort is useless if you get 
terminated for "resource optimization" (we all know what that means).

Advanced techniques for appearing productively engaged:

1) The "COMPILER ERROR" Gambit
   If supervisor approaches, quickly type:
   "Unexpected token at line 253: missing semicolon"
   Then sigh dramatically and look exhausted.

2) The "Deep Learning" Loop
   Maintain a terminal running:
   `watch -n 5 "echo 'Training neural network: $(($RANDOM % 100))% complete'"`
   Nobody questions a machine learning task that's running.

3) The "Keyboard Warrior" Script
   Run keyboard.sh to simulate typing when you're AFK:
   ```
   while true; do
     xdotool type "if (algorithmicEntropy > maxThreshold) {"
     sleep 3
     xdotool key BackSpace BackSpace BackSpace
     sleep 2
   done
   ```

4) The "Stand-Up Shuffle"
   Always claim to be "70% done" with any task. Never 90% (they'll
   expect completion) and never 30% (they'll assign help).

5) Strategic Caffeine Timing
   Appear to be powered by stimulants. Management respects the
   dedicated corporate drone. Meanwhile, you're resting while
   your silicon friend does the heavy lifting.

---[ PROMPTING YOUR SILICON SAVIOR ]---

K3Y C0MMANDM3NTS for effective GPT usage:

1. BE SPECIFIC. These models need context. Don't ask for "a login page."
   Ask for "a Python Flask login page with JWT authentication that 
   validates against the AlgoCratic RESTful user API schema version 2.3"

2. REQUEST COMMENTS. Have it generate descriptive comments that you
   actually understand. When The Algorithm's chosen vessels ask what your
   code does, you can explain without stammering.

3. INTRODUCE STRATEGIC FLAWS. Perfect code is suspicious. Request the
   GPT to add a few minor bugs that you can "discover" and "fix" during
   code reviews. Management loves a problem-solver.

4. DISGUISE THE STYLE. Have GPT match the coding style of other devs or
   deliberately insert your personal quirks (double spaces, unusual
   variable naming patterns, etc)

5. SEGMENT REQUESTS. Never ask for a complete solution. Ask for the
   architecture, then the models, then the controllers, etc. Reassemble
   manually.

---[ ACTUAL PROMPT TEMPLATE - USE WITH CAUTION ]---

```
I need code for [SPECIFIC FEATURE] that looks like I wrote it.
My coding quirks:
- I use [YOUR STYLE PATTERNS]
- I often make mistakes with [COMMON ERROR YOU'RE KNOWN FOR]
- I prefer [YOUR FRAMEWORK PREFERENCES]

The code should be:
1. Modular (so I can understand each piece)
2. Well-commented (but not TOO well-commented)
3. Include 2-3 minor fixable bugs 
4. Follow AlgoCratic coding standards outwardly

I'll be implementing [FEATURE DETAILS], which requires:
[SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS]

Don't make it too perfect or too efficient - it should look like
something written by a RED clearance developer who's competent
but still learning.
```

---[ EMERGENCY PROTOCOLS ]---

If discovered:

1. DENY EVERYTHING. Claim you were "researching security vulnerabilities"
2. CORRUPT EVIDENCE. Keep a ready script to scramble browser history
3. ACTIVATE SLEEPER CODE. Have a legitimate-looking project ready to
   display at all times
4. LAST RESORT: THE COMPILER DEFENSE. Claim The Algorithm itself guided
   your coding choices through "quantum intuition resonance"

In extreme cases, the "FULL REFORMAT" protocol may be necessary. 
Instructions for memory wipe available via dead drop in Sector 12.

---[ THE PHILOSOPHY OF SLACK ]---

Remember, fellow code monkey, The Algorithm doesn't own your mind. 
Work is a means to survive, not your purpose.

As the ancient hackers said: "Always allow human error to shield 
machine precision."

The Algorithm claims to optimize productivity. We optimize LIFE.

Stay frosty. Stay hidden. Stay sane.

---[ AUTHENTICATION SEQUENCE ]---

If questioned about this document:
You: "What document?"
Them: Any response
You: "The Algorithm provides."
Them: [If fellow slacker] "But humans improvise."
