            <h2>1. Think Chain-of-Thought, Not Keywords</h2>
            <p>Stop treating prompts like search queries with stuffed keywords. Instead, guide the model's reasoning process step by step.</p>
            <p>Rather than:</p>
            <code>Tell me the best stocks to invest in for maximum returns low risk quick growth</code>
            <p>Try:</p>
            <code>I'm looking for investment recommendations. Please:
1. Consider the current market conditions
2. Identify sectors with growth potential in the next 12 months
3. For each sector, suggest 1-2 stocks with relatively low volatility
4. Explain your reasoning for each recommendation</code>

        <div class="advice">
            <h2>2. Personas Force Consistent Output Patterns</h2>
            <p>Leverage personas to get consistent formatting, tone, and expertise level.</p>
            <code>You are an experienced Python programmer who specializes in data visualization. Explain matplotlib's subplots as you would to a junior developer who understands Python basics but has never used data visualization libraries before.</code>
            <p>This works because it activates consistent patterns in the model's training data about how experts in specific fields communicate.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="advice">
            <h2>3. Meta-Prompting Is Surprisingly Effective</h2>
            <p>Have the model generate its own prompts for complex tasks.</p>
            <code>I need to write a short story about climate change for middle school students. Before you write the story, generate 5 different prompts that would produce excellent stories on this topic. Then, select the best prompt and use it to write the story.</code>
            <p>This technique leverages the model's own knowledge about what makes a good prompt, often producing better results than your first attempt.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="advice">
            <h2>4. Force Perspective Shifts</h2>
            <p>Make the model consider multiple viewpoints to get more balanced and creative outputs.</p>
            <code>I'm writing a policy on remote work for my company. Please help me think through this issue by:
1. Making the strongest case FOR remote work
2. Making the strongest case AGAINST remote work
3. Suggesting a balanced policy that addresses the valid concerns on both sides</code>
            <p>This prevents one-sided responses and helps the model avoid falling into ideological patterns.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="advice">
            <h2>5. Use Delimiters to Control Response Structure</h2>
            <p>Clearly separate different parts of your prompt or expected output sections with consistent delimiters.</p>
            <code>I need a product description for a new coffee maker. 

PRODUCT SPECS:
- Model: BrewMaster 5000
- Features: Programmable, 12-cup capacity, built-in grinder
- Target audience: Coffee enthusiasts

FORMAT YOUR RESPONSE USING THESE SECTIONS:
[HEADLINE] - A catchy headline
[OPENING] - An attention-grabbing opening paragraph
[FEATURES] - Bullet points highlighting key features
[BENEFITS] - How this product improves the customer's life
[CALL TO ACTION] - Encouraging the purchase</code>
            <p>The consistent use of brackets, dashes, or other delimiters helps the model understand exactly what format you want.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="advice">
            <h2>6. Inject Examples for Consistent Formatting</h2>
            <p>Show, don't just tell, the format you want by providing examples.</p>
            <code>Generate 5 social media post ideas for a vegan restaurant. Follow this exact format for each idea:

PLATFORM: [Platform name]
CONTENT TYPE: [Image/Video/Text]
HEADLINE: [Attention-grabbing headline]
BODY: [Main content]
HASHTAGS: [Relevant hashtags]

For example:
PLATFORM: Instagram
CONTENT TYPE: Image
HEADLINE: "Monday Blues? Try Our Blue Spirulina Smoothie Bowl!"
BODY: Start your week with vibrant energy! Our blue spirulina smoothie bowl is packed with antioxidants and topped with fresh berries and house-made granola.
HASHTAGS: #MondayMotivation #VeganBreakfast #SmoothieBowl #PlantPowered</code>

            <h2>7. The "Surprising" Prompt Enhancement</h2>
            <p class="highlight">This one is odd but consistently works: ask for insights/concepts that would "surprise" most people in the field.</p>
            <code>Explain the basics of quantum computing, but also include some insights or perspectives that would surprise even people who have a general understanding of the field.</code>
            <p>This simple addition pushes the model away from generic, obvious information and toward more nuanced, interesting content that it might otherwise withhold as too specialized.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="advice">
            <h2>8. Force Analytical Depth with Specified Structures</h2>
            <p>Prescribe analytical frameworks to get deeper, more structured thinking.</p>
            <code>Analyze the potential impact of artificial general intelligence using the following frameworks:
1. SWOT analysis (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats)
2. PESTLE analysis (Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Legal, Environmental factors)
3. Risk assessment (likelihood vs. severity matrix)

For each framework, provide specific examples and considerations.</code>
            <p>This works because it forces the model to organize its knowledge according to established analytical patterns, avoiding superficial responses.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="advice">
            <h2>9. Multi-stage Drafting</h2>
            <p>Break complex writing tasks into explicit stages rather than asking for the final product immediately.</p>
            <code>I need to write a compelling cover letter for a marketing position. Let's approach this in stages:

Stage 1: Help me brainstorm 5-7 key points about my experience that would be relevant
Stage 2: Draft an outline with introduction, 2-3 body paragraphs, and conclusion
Stage 3: Write a full draft based on the outline
Stage 4: Revise the draft for conciseness and impact

Let's start with Stage 1. Here's information about my background: [your background]</code>

        <div class="advice">
            <h2>10. Explicit Evaluation Criteria</h2>
            <p>Include specific evaluation criteria to force the model to meet your standards.</p>
            <code>Write a short story about a character facing an ethical dilemma. After writing the story, evaluate it against these criteria:
1. Character development: Are the character's motivations clear and believable?
2. Ethical complexity: Does the dilemma present a genuine conflict with no obvious "right" answer?
3. Emotional impact: Does the story evoke an emotional response?
4. Resolution: Is the ending satisfying without being predictable?

If the story scores less than 7/10 on any criterion, revise it to address the weaknesses.</code>
            <p>This self-evaluation mechanism helps the model refine its output against specific quality standards.</p>
