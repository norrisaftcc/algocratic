## MICROCREDENTIAL CERTIFICATION CRITERIA

### For Flask Fundamentals Microcredential Certification (85+ points required):

Students must demonstrate:
1. **Technical Mastery**: Proper virtual environment usage, dependency management, and Flask application structure
2. **Corporate Integration**: Successful implementation of loyalty tracking with appropriate AlgoCratic messaging
3. **Problem-Solving**: Creative approaches to contradictory requirements that show understanding of real-world constraints
4. **Professional Practices**: Clean code, proper documentation, and thorough testing

### Oath Extension Authorization:

Upon achieving microcredential certification, students are authorized to extend their RED clearance daily activation sequence:

```bash
source loyalty_env/Scripts/activate
git status
python --version
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

This extension validates their ability to:
- Activate proper development environments
- Manage dependencies professionally
- Deploy functional web applications
- Follow corporate development protocols

## INSTRUCTOR NOTES

### Common Student Challenges:
1. **Virtual Environment Confusion**: Many students struggle with activation across different operating systems
2. **Requirements.txt Errors**: Students often forget to freeze dependencies or include wrong versions
3. **Template Inheritance**: Basic Jinja2 concepts need reinforcement
4. **Contradictory Requirements**: Students may ignore these initially - emphasize they're real-world training

### Grading Efficiency Tips:
1. **Automated Checks**: Verify virtual environment names and requirements.txt format programmatically
2. **Quick Validation**: Run their Flask app first - if it doesn't start, significant points lost immediately
3. **Corporate Messaging**: Look for AlgoCratic terminology and appropriate tone in user interface
4. **Structure Review**: Check file organization before diving into code quality

### Real-World Connection Emphasis:
Remind students that:
- Virtual environments prevent dependency conflicts in team development
- Requirements.txt enables consistent deployments across environments
- Template inheritance reduces code duplication and maintenance burden
- Handling contradictory requirements is a core professional skill
