# Pull Request Assignment Instructor Guide
## *Teaching Pull Requests Through Dystopian Bureaucracy*

**CLASSIFICATION: OUT-OF-CHARACTER**  
**DOCUMENT: INSTRUCTOR-PR-GUIDE-2025-05**

---

## Overview & Educational Goals

This assignment introduces students to GitHub pull requests through the lens of AlgoCratic's dystopian bureaucracy. The satirical approach deliberately exaggerates the formality and complexity of the pull request process to:

1. Make the actual process feel simple and accessible by comparison
2. Highlight the real purpose and value of pull requests in a memorable way
3. Create a shared, humorous experience that builds class cohesion
4. Reinforce the educational progression through clearance levels

By the end of this assignment, students should be able to:
- Create branches with meaningful names
- Make commits with clear, descriptive messages
- Create pull requests with appropriate descriptions
- Review other students' pull requests
- Merge approved changes while resolving conflicts

This assignment is designed for RED clearance level, correlating to Bloom's Comprehension/Understanding stage.

## The Pedagogical Method Behind the Madness

The seemingly ridiculous bureaucracy in the assignment is deliberately designed to highlight several important software development concepts:

1. **Process Documentation**: While exaggerated, the steps reflect a real-world development workflow
2. **Change Justification**: Students must articulate why changes are necessary
3. **Peer Review**: Emphasizes the importance of code review in quality control
4. **Conflict Resolution**: Exposes students to handling merge conflicts
5. **Documentation**: Teaches the importance of describing changes clearly

The satirical bureaucracy actually reinforces good practices that students will carry forward, even as they "rebel" against it at higher clearance levels.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Repository Preparation**:
   - Ensure each student has fork/clone access to the class repository
   - Create a simple starter project with deliberate "issues" for students to fix
   - Set branch protection rules on the main branch to require reviews

2. **Assignment Distribution**:
   - Provide the RED clearance pull request protocol document to students
   - Create matching tickets in your issue tracker (GitHub Issues works well)
   - Assign specific issues to student pairs or individuals

3. **Supplementary Materials**:
   - Create a shared "forms repository" containing mock versions of the referenced forms
   - Provide a simplified cheat sheet for the actual Git commands needed
   - Consider creating a short video demonstrating the process while maintaining the dystopian theme

## Classroom Implementation

### Day 1: Introduction (30-45 minutes)

1. Present the satirical "Algorithmic Revision Submission Protocolâ„¢" with a straight face
2. Allow students time to react to the absurd bureaucracy
3. Explain that this is how they'll be submitting code changes as RED clearance employees
4. Demonstrate the complete process once, maintaining the dystopian corporate character
5. Show students where to find the "forms" and reference materials

### Day 2: Guided Practice (45-60 minutes)

1. Walk students through creating their first pull request using the protocol
2. Have them complete simplified versions of the "forms" (which actually help them think about their changes)
3. Guide them through the actual Git commands:
   ```
   git checkout -b meaningful-branch-name
   # Make changes
   git add .
   git commit -m "Clear descriptive message"
   git push -u origin meaningful-branch-name
   # Create PR through GitHub interface
   ```
4. Show them how to fill out the pull request template (a simplified version of the satirical one)

### Days 3-5: Assignment Work

1. Students work on their assigned issues, following the protocol
2. Instructors and TAs roleplaying as ORANGE and YELLOW clearance reviewers
3. Provide feedback in character, with varying levels of bureaucratic nitpicking
4. Gradually approve PRs that meet the actual (reasonable) standards

## Assessment Strategy

### Formative Assessment

During the PR process, evaluate:
- Branch naming conventions
- Commit message quality
- Pull request descriptions
- Code quality
- Student participation in reviews

### Summative Assessment

After completion, evaluate:
- Successfully merged pull request(s)
- Quality of code changes
- Ability to address review feedback
- Collaboration with peers

### Grading Rubric

| Criterion | Excellent (A) | Satisfactory (B-C) | Needs Improvement (D-F) |
|-----------|---------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| PR Creation | Created PR with proper branch naming and description | Created PR with minor issues in process | Failed to create proper PR |
| Code Quality | Changes are well-implemented and solve the issue | Changes address the issue with some minor problems | Changes do not properly address the issue |
| Documentation | Excellent description of changes and reasoning | Basic description of changes | Minimal or no description |
| Peer Review | Provided thoughtful feedback on peers' PRs | Provided basic feedback on peers' PRs | Did not participate in peer review |
| Responsiveness | Quickly and effectively addressed review feedback | Addressed most review feedback | Failed to address review feedback |

## Revealing the Method (Follow-up Lesson)

After completing the assignment, schedule a debrief session to:

1. Acknowledge the deliberately excessive bureaucracy
2. Explain how the actual pull request process accomplishes key goals:
   - Documentation of changes
   - Peer review for quality
   - Maintaining stable main branch
   - Creating discussion around changes
3. Show how the satirical forms actually contained valuable questions:
   - What problem are you solving?
   - How did you test your solution?
   - What potential impacts could your changes have?
4. Connect to industry practices: even top tech companies require pull requests

## Progression to Advanced Concepts

This assignment sets the foundation for higher clearance levels:

1. **ORANGE**: Students learn to review PRs effectively and provide constructive feedback
2. **YELLOW**: Introduction to branching strategies and release management
3. **GREEN**: Empowerment to merge directly in appropriate situations, understanding when PRs are necessary
4. **BLUE+**: Design and implementation of custom workflows, automations, and CI/CD pipelines

Each progression adds autonomy while building on the fundamentals established here.

## Common Student Questions & Responses

| Question | In-Character Response | Out-of-Character Explanation |
|----------|----------------------|------------------------------|
| "Do we really need to fill out all these forms?" | "Form AF-DEV-INTENT-2025-05 is a mandatory prerequisite for all code modifications. Failure to complete proper documentation is a violation of protocol." | "The simplified PR template contains important information that will help reviewers understand your changes." |
| "Why is this process so complicated?" | "The Algorithm has calculated this to be the optimal procedure for maintaining code integrity. Are you questioning The Algorithm, citizen?" | "The real process is much simpler! We're exaggerating to help you appreciate the actual value of pull requests." |
| "Can I just push directly to main?" | "DIRECT MAIN BRANCH MODIFICATION IS A CLASS 2 VIOLATION. Report to Mandatory Loyalty Reassessment immediately." | "Branch protection prevents direct pushes to main for good reason - it ensures code is reviewed before being integrated." |
| "How long will review really take?" | "The Algorithm processes all requests in priority order based on your Loyalty Score. Increase productivity to expedite processing." | "We'll try to review PRs within 24-48 hours, but complex changes may take longer. This mirrors real-world timelines." |

## Tips for Instructors

1. **Stay in character** when appropriate to maintain the satirical environment
2. **Be flexible** with the actual requirements while maintaining the satirical facade
3. **Highlight good examples** of pull requests to establish proper norms
4. **Use humor** to defuse frustration if students struggle with the process
5. **Connect to industry** by sharing real-world examples of PR workflows
6. **Scale complexity** based on student experience level
