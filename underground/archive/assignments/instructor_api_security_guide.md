## ASSIGNMENT STRUCTURE & TECHNICAL FOCUS

### Core Components

The SecureGateway assignment challenges students to implement several security components that work together to protect an API:

1. **InputValidator:** Teaches proper input validation and sanitization
2. **SecurityToken:** Covers JWT-like token implementation for authentication
3. **RateLimiter:** Demonstrates protection against denial-of-service attacks
4. **RequestSigner:** Teaches cryptographic verification of request integrity
5. **PayloadEncryptor:** Covers encryption techniques for sensitive data
6. **AnomalyDetector:** Introduces behavioral security monitoring
7. **SecureGateway:** Demonstrates integration of all security components

### Progressive Security Levels

The assignment introduces the concept of security levels with increasing protection requirements:

- **PUBLIC:** Basic validation and rate limiting
- **STANDARD:** Adds token authentication and authorization
- **ELEVATED:** Adds request signing for integrity verification
- **CRITICAL:** Adds payload encryption and anomaly detection

This tiered approach teaches students to apply security controls proportionate to the sensitivity of the protected resources - a critical concept in real-world security architecture.

## IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE

### Setting Up the Assignment

1. **Prerequisite Knowledge:**
   - Students should have basic understanding of HTTP and RESTful APIs
   - Familiarity with cryptographic concepts (hashing, encryption) is helpful
   - Understanding of authentication concepts (tokens, JWTs) is beneficial

2. **Environment Preparation:**
   - Standard Python 3.7+ environment with standard libraries
   - No external dependencies are required (intentionally uses standard library)
   - Consider providing reference documentation for the Python `hmac`, `hashlib`, and `base64` modules

3. **Time Allocation:**
   - Recommend 3-4 hours total working time
   - Can be divided into multiple sessions focusing on different components

### Execution Approach

1. **Recommended Implementation Sequence:**
   - Start with the `InputValidator` class (fundamental to all security)
   - Move to the `SecurityToken` and authentication mechanisms
   - Implement the `RateLimiter` component
   - Add the `RequestSigner` for integrity verification
   - Build the `PayloadEncryptor` for data protection
   - Develop the `AnomalyDetector` for behavioral monitoring
   - Finally, integrate all components in the `SecureGateway` class

2. **Key Challenges for Students:**
   - Understanding the security implications of each component
   - Implementing proper error handling and security exceptions
   - Balancing security with usability and performance
   - Developing comprehensive tests that verify security properties

3. **Common Implementation Pitfalls:**

   | Challenge | Pedagogical Approach |
   |-----------|----------------------|
   | Inadequate input validation | Show examples of security bypasses with improper validation |
   | Weak cryptographic implementations | Explain importance of using standard libraries correctly |
   | Missing edge cases in security checks | Review common security bypass techniques |
   | Over-reliance on single security control | Emphasize defense-in-depth principle |

## TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION TIPS

When students struggle with specific components, provide these implementation hints:

### Input Validation

```python
def validate_string(self, value: str, min_length: int = 1, max_length: int = 100, 
                  pattern: Optional[str] = None) -> str:
    """
    Validates and sanitizes a string value.
    """
    if not isinstance(value, str):
        raise ValidationError(f"Expected string, got {type(value).__name__}")
        
    if len(value) < min_length:
        raise ValidationError(f"String too short (minimum {min_length} characters)")
        
    if len(value) > max_length:
        raise ValidationError(f"String too long (maximum {max_length} characters)")
        
    if pattern and pattern in self.patterns:
        if not self.patterns[pattern].match(value):
            raise ValidationError(f"String does not match required pattern for {pattern}")
            
    # Basic sanitization - remove control characters
    sanitized = re.sub(r'[\x00-\x1F\x7F]', '', value)
    
    return sanitized
```

### Security Token Generation

```python
def generate_token(self, user_id: str, permissions: List[str], 
                  metadata: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None) -> str:
    """
    Generates a secure authentication token.
    """
    # Create the payload
    now = datetime.now()
    expiration = now + timedelta(minutes=self.config.token_expiration)
    
    payload = {
        "user_id": user_id,
        "permissions": permissions,
        "iat": int(now.timestamp()),
        "exp": int(expiration.timestamp()),
        "jti": str(uuid.uuid4()),  # Unique token ID
    }
    
    if metadata:
        payload["metadata"] = metadata
        
    # Encode the payload
    payload_json = json.dumps(payload)
    payload_b64 = b64encode(payload_json.encode()).decode()
    
    # Generate the signature
    signature = self._generate_signature(payload_b64)
    
    # Combine into token
    token = f"{payload_b64}.{signature}"
    
    return token
```

### Rate Limiting

```python
def check_rate_limit(self, client_id: str, security_level: SecurityLevel) -> bool:
    """
    Checks if a request exceeds the rate limit.
    """
    now = time.time()
    window_start = now - 60  # 1-minute rolling window
    
    # Initialize client if not seen before
    if client_id not in self.request_log:
        self.request_log[client_id] = []
        
    # Remove old requests outside the window
    self.request_log[client_id] = [
        timestamp for timestamp in self.request_log[client_id]
        if timestamp >= window_start
    ]
    
    # Get the limit for this security level
    limit = self.get_limit_for_level(security_level)
    
    # Check if limit exceeded
    if len(self.request_log[client_id]) >= limit:
        raise RateLimitExceededError(
            f"Rate limit exceeded for {security_level.name} endpoint. "
            f"Limit: {limit} requests per minute."
        )
        
    return True
```

### Request Signing

```python
def sign_request(self, method: str, endpoint: str, body: Dict[str, Any],
               timestamp: Optional[str] = None) -> Dict[str, str]:
    """
    Signs a request for authentication.
    """
    if timestamp is None:
        timestamp = datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ")
        
    # Generate the base string to sign
    base_string = self._generate_signature_base(method, endpoint, body, timestamp)
    
    # Create the HMAC signature
    key = self.config.hmac_key.encode()
    h = hmac.new(key, base_string.encode(), hashlib.sha256)
    signature = b64encode(h.digest()).decode()
    
    return {
        "signature": signature,
        "timestamp": timestamp
    }
```

### Payload Encryption

```python
def encrypt_payload(self, payload: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, str]:
    """
    Encrypts a payload for secure transmission.
    """
    from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers import Cipher, algorithms, modes
    from cryptography.hazmat.backends import default_backend
    import os
    
    # Convert payload to JSON string
    payload_json = json.dumps(payload)
    
    # Generate random salt and IV
    salt = os.urandom(16)
    iv = os.urandom(16)
    
    # Derive encryption key from master key and salt
    key = self._generate_encryption_key(salt)
    
    # Encrypt the payload
    cipher = Cipher(
        algorithms.AES(key),
        modes.CBC(iv),
        backend=default_backend()
    )
    encryptor = cipher.encryptor()
    
    # Pad the plaintext to block size
    padded = payload_json.encode()
    block_size = 16
    padding_length = block_size - (len(padded) % block_size)
    padded += bytes([padding_length]) * padding_length
    
    # Perform encryption
    ciphertext = encryptor.update(padded) + encryptor.finalize()
    
    # Encode binary data for transmission
    return {
        "data": b64encode(ciphertext).decode(),
        "iv": b64encode(iv).decode(),
        "salt": b64encode(salt).decode()
    }
```

### Anomaly Detection

```python
def analyze_request(self, client_id: str, endpoint: str, method: str, 
                  body: Dict[str, Any], ip_address: str) -> bool:
    """
    Analyzes a request for suspicious patterns.
    """
    # Initialize client tracking if new
    if client_id not in self.client_patterns:
        self.client_patterns[client_id] = {
            "endpoints": {},
            "errors": [],
            "request_count": 0,
            "last_seen": time.time(),
            "ip_addresses": set()
        }
    
    client = self.client_patterns[client_id]
    
    # Update endpoint frequency
    if endpoint not in client["endpoints"]:
        client["endpoints"][endpoint] = 0
    client["endpoints"][endpoint] += 1
    
    # Update client data
    client["request_count"] += 1
    client["last_seen"] = time.time()
    client["ip_addresses"].add(ip_address)
    
    # Check for suspicious patterns
    if self.check_brute_force_attempt(client_id, endpoint):
        raise SecurityViolationError(
            "Suspicious activity detected: Possible brute force attack")
    
    if self.check_unusual_access_pattern(client_id, endpoint):
        # Just flag as suspicious but allow for now
        # More advanced systems might block based on this
        return False
    
    # Record the endpoint in global patterns too
    if endpoint not in self.global_patterns["endpoints"]:
        self.global_patterns["endpoints"][endpoint] = 0
    self.global_patterns["endpoints"][endpoint] += 1
    
    return True
```
