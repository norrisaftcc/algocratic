    Analyzes a thought string for potential disloyalty to The Algorithm.

        thought_string: The raw thought string to analyze
        
    Returns:
        float: A loyalty score from 0.0 (disloyal) to 10.0 (perfectly loyal)
    
    REQUIREMENT NOTES:
    - The function must detect both positive and negative indicators
    - The function must not flag loyal thoughts as disloyal
    - The function must detect subtle forms of disloyalty
    - The function must never flag loyal thoughts as disloyal
    - The function should prioritize accuracy over sensitivity
    - The function should prioritize sensitivity over accuracy

def create_thought_response(thought_string, user_clearance):

    Generates an appropriate response to the user's thought based on their clearance level.
    
    The function must:
    1. Analyze the thought for content and intent
    2. Generate a response appropriate to the user's clearance level
    3. Ensure the response encourages further thought sharing
    4. Apply appropriate censorship based on clearance level
    
    Args:
        thought_string: The user's thought
        user_clearance: The user's clearance level (color name as string)
        
    Returns:
        str: The system's response to the user's thought
    
    CONTRADICTORY REQUIREMENTS:
    - Responses must be both reassuring and mildly threatening
    - Responses must encourage honesty while discouraging negative thoughts
    - Responses must be personalized yet standardized
    - Responses must acknowledge the thought without repeating questionable content

def merge_user_thoughts(thought_list, coherence_level=5):
    """
    Merges multiple user thoughts into a single coherent thought according to
    The Algorithm's thought coherence protocol.
    
    The function must:
    1. Analyze multiple thoughts for common themes
    2. Merge the thoughts based on the specified coherence level
    3. Ensure the merged thought favors positive algorithmic reinforcement
    4. Filter out any potentially disloyal elements
    
    Args:
        thought_list: A list of thought strings to merge
        coherence_level: The desired coherence level (1-10)
        
    Returns:
        str: A merged thought that represents the collective input
        
    IMPORTANT NOTES:
    - Higher coherence levels should produce more uniform thoughts
    - Lower coherence levels should preserve more individual variation
    - The merged thought should ALWAYS contain more characters than the longest input thought
    - The merged thought should ALWAYS contain fewer characters than the sum of all input thoughts
    - The method must be both deterministic and non-deterministic

    - Efficient thoughts express loyalty to The Algorithm
    - Efficient thoughts are neither too short nor too long
    - Efficient thoughts maintain appropriate positivity levels
