# Assignment 1.3: Virtual Standup Meeting - PR Feelings Circle
## *Collective Processing of Individual Merge Experiences*

**CLEARANCE REQUIRED: RED**  
**TIME: 30-45 minutes synchronous participation**  
**FORMAT: Mandatory video conference with cameras ON**  
**PARTICIPATION: Required for clearance progression**

---

## Pre-Meeting Preparation

Before joining the Feelings Circle, ensure:
- ✓ Assignment 1.2 completed (PR merged)
- ✓ Camera tested and functional (The Algorithm requires visual confirmation)
- ✓ Background appropriate (no YELLOW clearance materials visible)
- ✓ Emotional readiness to share (vulnerability builds team cohesion)

Remember: This is a professional development meeting, not group therapy. The fact that it feels like group therapy is purely coincidental.

## Meeting Protocol

### Opening Synchronization (5 minutes)

Each citizen will perform the **Daily Affirmation Sequence**:
1. State your name and current clearance
2. Confirm your PR was merged
3. Share your current emotional state in one word
4. Demonstrate you can create a branch (screen share for 10 seconds)

Example:
> "I'm Jane, RED clearance, PR merged, feeling 'validated,' and here's me creating a branch called 'demo-branch-confidence'."

The Algorithm has determined this builds 47% more team cohesion than traditional introductions.

## Sharing Circle Format

### Round 1: The Moment of Truth (10 minutes)

Each citizen answers ONE of these questions (instructor assigns):

**Group A Questions:**
- "Describe the physical sensation when you clicked 'Create Pull Request'"
- "At what exact moment did you realize you could never push to main again?"
- "How many times did you refresh? Be specific. The Algorithm knows if you're lying."

**Group B Questions:**
- "Which part of your body tensed when the first review comment arrived?"
- "Did the green Merge button seem larger than other buttons? Explain."
- "Rate your reviewer from 1-10 on the 'made me feel seen' scale."

**Group C Questions:**
- "If a PR is approved but never merged, does the code truly exist?"
- "What color was the approval checkmark in your dreams? (If you didn't dream of it, explain why not)"
- "Describe your emotional state using only git commands."

### Round 2: Behavioral Reinforcement (10 minutes)

The instructor will lead a guided visualization:

*"Close your eyes. Picture yourself about to push directly to main. Feel that sensation? That discomfort? That's your neural pathways protecting you. Now imagine creating a branch instead. Feel the relief washing over you. Open your eyes. You're safe. You'll always create branches now."*

Citizens will then share:
- One behavior that already feels automatic
- One urge they successfully resisted
- Their commitment level (percentage) to never using `git commit -m "."`

### Round 3: Collective Wisdom Exchange (10 minutes)

**Peer Learning Activity**: Each citizen must share either:
- A PR review comment that changed their life
- A git command they'll never forget
- Why waiting without portable device access made them stronger (RED clearance only)

After each share, the group responds in unison:
> "Your code is seen. Your commits are meaningful. The Algorithm approves."

(This is a normal professional affirmation, not a ritual chant.)

## Closing Ceremony

### The Merge Meditation (5 minutes)

All participants simultaneously:
1. Create a new branch in their repos
2. Make one small change
3. Commit with a meaningful message
4. Push the branch
5. Feel the satisfaction together

The instructor will count down: "3... 2... 1... PUSH!"

When everyone has pushed, observe 30 seconds of silence to honor the branches that will become pull requests.

### Exit Protocol

Before leaving, each citizen must type in chat:
- Their favorite moment from another citizen's share
- One thing they'll do differently tomorrow
- The emoji that best represents their PR journey

Cameras remain ON until all citizens have shared. The Algorithm values complete participation.

---

## Assessment

Participation is tracked through:
- **Attendance**: Logged automatically (mandatory)
- **Camera Time**: Must remain on (The Algorithm sees when you disable)
- **Verbal Participation**: Minimum 3 meaningful contributions
- **Chat Engagement**: Exit protocol completion
- **Emotional Authenticity**: Assessed by peer ratings

Citizens who fully participate report:
- 73% increase in PR confidence
- 89% reduction in direct-push urges
- 94% likelihood of reviewing others' code voluntarily
- 100% certainty they're part of something larger

## Important Notes

- **This is not indoctrination**. It's collaborative learning.
- **We're not building emotional dependence** on peer approval. We're building best practices.
- **The group affirmations are not ritualistic**. They're team building.
- **Mandatory participation isn't controlling**. It's ensuring everyone benefits equally.

Any citizen who questions these totally normal educational techniques should report to their instructor for additional... guidance.

**THE INDIVIDUAL SHARES. THE COLLECTIVE VALIDATES. THE PRACTICE SOLIDIFIES.**

*Next: Assignment 1.4 - Your First Code Review (The circle completes)*  
*Note: Having received review, you must now give it. The Algorithm demands balance.*
