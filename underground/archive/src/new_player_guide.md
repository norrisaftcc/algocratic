## What is AlgoCratic Futures™?

Welcome! You're about to participate in an immersive educational experience designed to teach software development teamwork, problem-solving, and professional resilience through a satirical dystopian corporate environment.

AlgoCratic Futures™ is a simulation — a form of educational role-play where you'll take on the role of an employee in a fictional tech corporation run by "The Algorithm." This experience combines coding challenges, team collaboration, and narrative elements to create an engaging learning environment.

> **Important:** The dystopian corporate setting is intentionally satirical and exaggerated. The bureaucracy, surveillance themes, and corporate doublespeak are all part of the fiction we create together to make learning engaging and memorable.

## Safety Mechanisms & Player Comfort

### The "INFRARED Distress Button"

Throughout the experience, you'll see references to an "under-desk INFRARED distress button" in the in-character materials. This is our primary safety mechanism:

* **To use it:** Raise your left hand and keep it raised.
* **What it means:** "I'm not playing right now." This signals to instructors and other participants that you need a break from the immersive experience.
* **When to use it:** If you're feeling uncomfortable, unwell, need a break, or need to step out for any reason.
* **What happens:** You can either remain seated (if you just need a moment) or leave the room briefly. The simulation will continue, but you won't be expected to participate until you're ready to rejoin.

This mechanism allows you to temporarily step out of character without disrupting the experience for others.

Remember that your well-being is more important than the simulation. The instructors are here to ensure everyone has a positive learning experience.

## Clearance Levels & Educational Progression

In AlgoCratic Futures™, your character starts with INFRARED clearance (the lowest level) and can progress through the clearance hierarchy:

* **INFRARED** - Entry level, focuses on following instructions and learning basics
* **RED** - Basic competency, building simple features
* **ORANGE** - Developing skills, implementing complete features
* **YELLOW** - Advanced capability, architectural decisions
* **GREEN** - Mastery, system design and leadership

This progression mirrors both Bloom's taxonomy of learning and real-world software development roles. As you demonstrate mastery, you'll "earn" more freedom and autonomy in the simulation.

> Note: The clearance progression is designed to make the educational journey more engaging by framing skill development as "rebellion" against bureaucracy. As you gain higher clearance, you'll get more freedom to make decisions and fewer arbitrary constraints.

## Getting Started

To begin your journey at AlgoCratic Futures™:

1. Read your INFRARED Clearance Guide completely
2. Complete your initial onboarding tasks
3. Follow instructions from higher clearance employees (your instructors)
4. Collaborate with fellow INFRARED resources (your classmates)
5. Work toward your first clearance elevation

Remember that the struggle is part of the experience. AlgoCratic Futures™ deliberately presents challenges that may seem arbitrary or contradictory — working through these challenges is how you'll develop problem-solving skills.
