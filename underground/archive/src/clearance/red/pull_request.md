## ALGORITHMIC REVISION SUBMISSION PROTOCOL

As a RED clearance Junior Innovation Contributor, you are now authorized to submit your code modifications to The Algorithm's Central Repository through the Algorithmic Revision Submission Protocol (commonly referred to as "pull requests" in legacy documentation).

### Pre-Submission Checklist:

Before initiating the Algorithmic Revision Submission process, ensure:

* All code modifications comply with the Code Modification Protocols
* All automated tests pass in your local environment
* Code has been reviewed for security vulnerabilities
* No debugging code or commented-out code remains
* All required documentation has been updated
* Your branch is synchronized with the latest approved baseline

> **ATTENTION:** Incomplete submissions reflect poorly on your efficiency metrics and loyalty score. Repeated submission of substandard code may result in revocation of modification privileges.

### Required Submission Format:

Your Algorithmic Revision Submission must follow this exact template:

```
[RED-<ID>] <Feature/Bug> - <Brief Description>

## Objective
<Concise statement of what this submission accomplishes>

## Implementation Approach
<Brief description of how you implemented the solution>

## Verification Method
<Description of how you verified your changes work correctly>

## Risks and Mitigations
<Known limitations or potential issues with mitigations>

## Related Components
<List of other components potentially affected>
```

> **SURVIVAL TIP:** The most successful revision submissions focus on addressing a single concern with minimal changes to existing code. The Algorithm favors small, focused updates over large, complex modifications.

### Review Assignment Protocol:

Once submitted, your revision will be automatically assigned to:

1. At least one fellow RED clearance colleague for peer review
2. One ORANGE clearance Technical Implementation Specialist for approval review
3. Automated testing and validation systems

All feedback must be addressed promptly according to the following guidelines:

* Technical changes requested by ORANGE clearance personnel must be implemented exactly as specified
* Suggestions from RED clearance peers should be carefully considered
* All automated testing issues must be resolved before re-submission

### Common Submission Rejection Reasons:

* Insufficient test coverage
* Deviance from approved specifications
* Code style violations
* Documentation omissions
* Excessive complexity in implementation
* Unauthorized scope expansion
* Performance degradation without justification

### Post-Approval Protocol:

After your submission has been approved:

1. The ORANGE clearance Technical Implementation Specialist will merge your changes
2. You must verify the changes function correctly in the development environment
3. Document any unexpected behavior in the issue tracking system
4. Close the associated task in the task allocation system

> **ATTENTION:** RED clearance personnel are NOT authorized to merge their own submissions, regardless of approval status. Attempting to do so is a serious protocol violation.

### Submission Success Metrics:

Your Algorithmic Revision Submissions are evaluated on the following criteria:

* First-time approval rate
* Code quality metrics
* Implementation efficiency
* Documentation clarity
* Testing thoroughness
* Time to address feedback

These metrics directly contribute to your Productivity and Innovation scores, which are critical factors for clearance elevation consideration.
