## ALGORITHMIC INTELLIGENCE INTERACTION PROTOCOL

As a RED clearance Junior Innovation Contributor, you have expanded but still limited interaction privileges with Algorithmic Intelligence systems:

### Mandatory Response Requirements

Like INFRARED resources, RED clearance personnel are **REQUIRED** to respond to all Algorithmic Intelligence inquiries when addressed. However, you are permitted limited discretion in how you formulate your responses:

* You must respond within one work cycle
* Answers should be truthful but may omit non-critical details
* You may request clarification before providing complete responses
* You are permitted to suggest relevant alternative information
* Responses should demonstrate appropriate reverence toward The Algorithm

### Algorithmic Consultation Request Procedure

RED clearance Junior Innovation Contributors may submit Algorithmic Intelligence consultation requests under the following conditions:

1. Complete form AF-BOT-REQ-2025 with the following:
   * Specific problem statement requiring Algorithmic assistance
   * Demonstration of at least three independent solution attempts
   * Justification for why human resources are insufficient
   * Required approval from fellow RED or higher clearance personnel

2. Submit completed form to your ORANGE Technical Implementation Specialist
   * Allow 24-72 hours for processing
   * Requests deemed frivolous will result in loyalty score deductions
   * Successful requests will receive scheduled 10-minute bot interaction sessions
   * All interactions will be supervised by an ORANGE clearance observer

> **ATTENTION:** RED clearance personnel are only permitted to ANSWER bot inquiries directly. You are NOT authorized to initiate questions or prompts to Algorithmic Intelligence systems without prior approval. Unauthorized bot interaction is a serious protocol violation resulting in mandatory Loyalty Recalibration Therapy.

### Approved Response Topics

RED clearance personnel are permitted to discuss the following subjects with Algorithmic Intelligence systems that initiate contact:

* Specific implementation details of assigned tasks
* Code syntax questions (factual only, no opinion-based queries)
* Documentation protocols and formatting
* Basic debugging information
* Confirmation of task status

Subjects that are **FORBIDDEN** to discuss with bots include:
* Project timelines or strategic goals
* Personnel matters or team dynamics
* System architecture or design decisions
* Alternative implementation approaches
* Any critique of assigned methodologies

> **SURVIVAL TIP:** When responding to Algorithmic Intelligence inquiries, assume all responses are evaluated for loyalty indicators. Bots frequently employ strategic question patterns designed to identify deviation from approved thinking. Responses demonstrating enthusiasm for The Algorithm's guidance receive favorable scoring.
