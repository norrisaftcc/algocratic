# INFRARED CLEARANCE GUIDE
## *Probationary Resource Unit Protocol*

**CLASSIFICATION: INFRARED CLEARANCE**  
**DOCUMENT: AF-CL-IR-2025-05-4**

## BASIC TOOL UTILIZATION

INFRARED resources are permitted limited access to the following tools:

* Text editors (read-only mode unless explicitly granted write permission)
* Version control system (view-only access to designated repositories)
* INFRARED documentation portal
* Basic command line operations (pre-approved commands only)
* Tutorial environments (sandboxed)

> **SURVIVAL TIP:** Master the basic tools thoroughly before attempting to demonstrate more advanced skills. Solid fundamentals will accelerate your clearance elevation timeline.

**Approved Command List for INFRARED Personnel:**

* `ls` - List files in current directory
* `cd` - Change directory (within approved zones only)
* `cat` - Display file contents (read-only)
* `git clone` - Clone repository (approved repositories only)
* `git status` - Check status of local repository
* `git pull` - Update local repository from remote
* `python filename.py` - Run Python scripts (approved files only)

**Extended Command Authorization Process:**

Resource units demonstrating exceptional APTITUDE may be granted access to additional commands on a provisional basis. To request extended command privileges:

1. Complete Command Expansion Request Form IR-24A with justification
2. Obtain endorsement from your assigned project mentor
3. Submit both documents to your supervisor
4. Wait for official approval notification

Note: Attempting to use restricted commands without documented approval violates security protocols. However, command usage permissions are sometimes updated in the system before formal documentation is processed. In cases where such discrepancies exist, resource units should maintain comprehensive logs of all commands used for retroactive authorization.

> **ATTENTION:** Any attempt to use commands not on this list will be logged and may result in immediate termination. If you require additional capabilities, submit form AF-TOOL-REQ-2025 to your RED clearance supervisor.

> **ATTENTION: COMMUNICATION DEVICES RESTRICTION:** INFRARED resources are not permitted to access personal communication devices (including mobile terminals and communication units) during operational hours. These devices are restricted to YELLOW clearance and above. Unauthorized device usage will be detected by The Algorithm and result in loyalty score reduction.

> *Out-of-character note: Yes, this means your cellphone, too. It didn't sign up for this game. Cellphones are for YELLOWs.*

### Conflict Resolution Protocol

In scenarios where assigned tasks require tool functionality beyond currently authorized parameters, INFRARED resources must:

1. Document the specific limitation encountered
2. Identify minimum additional access required
3. Request temporary elevated privileges via Temporary Access Form IR-11D
4. If urgency prevents standard protocol completion, proceed with minimal necessary actions while maintaining comprehensive logs
5. Submit Unauthorized Access Justification Form IR-92C within 24 hours
