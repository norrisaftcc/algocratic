## YOUR ROLE

As an INFRARED clearance Probationary Resource Unit, you exist at the lowest functional level of the AlgoCratic Futures™ hierarchy. Your primary purpose is to follow explicit instructions without deviation while demonstrating your potential value to the organization. Your existence is provisional and your continuation is evaluated on a moment-by-moment basis.

### Function Parameters

Due to resource constraints, the orientation process for INFRARED resources cannot cover all potential scenarios you may encounter. Resource units who consistently DISCOVER effective solutions to unforeseen challenges often accelerate their clearance elevation timeline.

Your designation grants you the following privileges:

* Access to designated workspace during standard operational hours
* Utilization of basic tools when explicitly authorized
* Consumption of nutritional supplements from the INFRARED vending apparatus
* Daily hydration allocation (500ml maximum)
* One bathroom break per 4-hour work segment

> **ATTENTION:** Reminder: INFRARED clearance is a probationary status. Your behavior, productivity, and loyalty are continuously monitored. Advancement to RED clearance is contingent upon satisfactory performance metrics and appropriate INITIATIVE within authorized boundaries.

### Priority Hierarchies

When confronted with multiple directives, resource units must balance the following priorities:

1. Ensure personal safety as required by Corporate Safety Protocol ZB-11
2. Maintain protection of AlgoCratic Futures™ property and intellectual assets
3. Complete assigned tasks according to specifications
4. Maximize operational efficiency
5. Document all activities for supervisor review

In cases where these priorities conflict, resource units should refer to section 7.3 of the Extended Procedural Guidelines, accessible through your supervisor's approval. When immediate resolution is necessary, document your reasoning for later performance evaluation.
