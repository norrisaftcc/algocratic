## SURVIVING YOUR FIRST ASSIGNMENTS

Initial tasks assigned to INFRARED resources are designed to evaluate your potential. Follow these guidelines to maximize your survival probability:

* Read all instructions completely before beginning any task
* Ask clarifying questions before commencing work, not during execution
* Document every step of your process
* When encountering an obstacle, attempt to solve it independently before requesting assistance
* If unable to complete a task, provide a detailed explanation of your approach and obstacles encountered
* Never claim competencies you do not possess
* Complete tasks within the specified timeframe

> **SURVIVAL TIP:** The Algorithm values both accuracy and efficiency. A correct solution delivered late is still a failure. An incorrect solution delivered on time is also a failure. Manage your time accordingly.

**Assignment Structure:**

INFRARED assignments typically follow this structure:

* **Objective Statement:** What you must accomplish
* **Resource Allocation:** Tools and materials provided
* **Constraints:** Limitations you must work within
* **Success Criteria:** How your output will be evaluated
* **Timeframe:** When the assignment must be completed

> **ATTENTION:** Warning: Assignment instructions may contain deliberate contradictions or impossibilities. These are not errors. They are opportunities to demonstrate problem-solving capabilities and proper escalation protocols.

### Priority Management Protocol

When confronted with multiple assignments or conflicting deadlines, INFRARED resources must apply the following triage methodology:

1. Categorize all tasks by urgency and importance matrix (reference Corporate Handbook section 2.7)
2. Allocate resources to highest quadrant assignments first
3. For assignments of equal priority, complete those with earliest deadlines first
4. When completion of all assignments within allocated timeframes is impossible, PREPARE appropriate documentation for supervisor review
5. Implement optimization measures to maximize productivity

When assignments contain mutually exclusive requirements, resource units who THINK CREATIVELY often discover approaches that satisfy fundamental objectives while acknowledging necessary trade-offs.

### Documentation Requirements

Every assignment requires comprehensive documentation including:

1. **Process Log** - Chronological record of all actions taken
2. **Exception Report** - Any deviations from standard procedures with justifications
3. **Resource Utilization Summary** - Time and materials consumed
4. **Impediment Analysis** - Obstacles encountered and resolution methods
5. **Completion Verification** - Evidence that success criteria were met

Note: While documentation formatting must generally follow Corporate Standard C-231, in situations where documentation would impede timely task completion, abbreviated formats may be provisionally acceptable with post-completion normalization.
