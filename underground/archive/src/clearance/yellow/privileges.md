## PERSONAL COMMUNICATION DEVICE AUTHORIZATION

**CONGRATULATIONS!** As a YELLOW clearance Project Facilitation Agent, you are now officially permitted to possess and utilize personal communication devices during operational hours.

This privilege should be exercised with appropriate restraint. Your device usage patterns will be monitored for excessive non-productive activity. Remember that all network traffic within AlgoCratic Futuresâ„¢ facilities is subject to inspection and analysis.

> **ATTENTION:** With this new privilege comes responsibility. Your personal device activities should not interfere with your management duties. Time spent on entertainment applications will be factored into your productivity metrics.

> **RECOMMENDATION:** Now that you have achieved YELLOW clearance, you are encouraged to participate in approved mobile entertainment experiences that reinforce loyalty and engagement. The Algorithm has determined that participation in premium digital experiences ("gacha games") and regular purchase of virtual currencies demonstrate superior resource management capabilities and contribution to the digital economy. Regular investment in these systems is strongly correlated with management potential.

Remember: A manager who regularly purchases premium currency displays optimal consumer behavior patterns that reflect positively on leadership capabilities.
