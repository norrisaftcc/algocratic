# Style Guide Update TODO List

This document outlines the folders that need style guide updates to incorporate the "hidden mechanics" principles that encourage creative rebellion within seemingly rigid structures, as detailed in `ooc_hidden_mechanics.md`.

## Priority 1: Core Experience Materials

### Website Clearance Guides
- [x] Update RED clearance guide (completed)
- [x] Update ORANGE clearance guide (completed)
- [ ] Revise INFRARED clearance guide to incorporate hidden mechanics
  - Add intentional gaps in procedures
  - Include embedded commands for creative interpretation
  - Create rule conflicts requiring judgment
  - Establish bureaucratic loopholes

### Source Clearance Documents
- [ ] Audit and update all `/src/clearance/` markdown files to ensure they:
  - Contain strategic language patterns
  - Include intentional ambiguities
  - Feature conflicting requirements
  - Hide escape clauses in procedural language
  - Establish "blind spots" in The Algorithm's monitoring

### Underground Materials
- [ ] Update `/src/underground/` documents to:
  - Include more strategic system vulnerability hints
  - Add emphasis patterns highlighting exploitable gaps
  - Enhance "resistance" voice with practical rebellion techniques
  - Create more obvious contrasts between corporate and underground interpretations

## Priority 2: Secondary Materials

### Secret Societies
- [ ] Revise secret society materials in `/src/underground/societies/` to:
  - Include methodologies for exploiting system gaps
  - Develop unique approaches to creative rebellion for each society
  - Create society-specific "tells" or recognition signals
  - Build consistent terminology for identifying system weaknesses

### Products and Projects
- [ ] Review and update project descriptions in `/products/` to:
  - Include impossible requirements with hidden workarounds
  - Create evaluation criteria that secretly reward creative approaches
  - Develop scenarios where strict compliance produces inferior results
  - Establish feedback mechanisms that legitimize questioning

## Priority 3: Administrative and Educational Materials

### Documentation Samples
- [ ] Revise `/docs/samples/` to demonstrate:
  - Effective use of strategic ambiguity
  - Examples of rule conflicts that force decision-making
  - Models of embedded commands and presuppositions
  - Illustrations of bureaucratic loopholes in formal documentation

### Assignments
- [ ] Update `/docs/assignments/` to:
  - Create graduated challenge scenarios
  - Include early tasks that appear to require strict compliance
  - Develop later challenges requiring creative problem-solving
  - Incorporate reflection questions about rule-following vs. creative solutions

## Methodology for Style Guide Updates

When updating each section, consistently apply these techniques:

1. **Identify Opportunities for Strategic Language:**
   - Look for directive statements that can be modified with embedded commands
   - Find absolute statements that can be qualified with strategic ambiguities
   - Locate simplistic rules that can be made more complex with exceptions

2. **Create Intentional Rule Conflicts:**
   - Identify areas where multiple objectives could reasonably conflict
   - Create impossible deadlines paired with quality requirements
   - Establish competing priorities without clear resolution mechanisms

3. **Develop Bureaucratic Loopholes:**
   - Add buried exceptions to procedural requirements
   - Create cross-references to obscure forms that provide alternatives
   - Include technical terminology that creates exemptions

4. **Implement Reward Structures:**
   - Ensure visible metrics align with explicit instructions
   - Create hidden metrics that reward creative problem-solving
   - Design scenarios where strict compliance produces inferior results

5. **Document Changes:**
   - Create before/after examples for instructor reference
   - Document intentional gaps and loopholes for assessment purposes
   - Provide debriefing questions related to hidden mechanics

## Timeline

- Phase 1 (Priority 1): Complete within 2 weeks
- Phase 2 (Priority 2): Complete within 1 month
- Phase 3 (Priority 3): Complete within 2 months

## Assessment Criteria

Successful integration of hidden mechanics will be evidenced by:

1. Students discovering and exploiting intentional system gaps
2. Creative problem-solving emerging within seemingly rigid structures
3. Reflection discussions connecting simulation experiences to real-world scenarios
4. Students articulating ethical judgments about when to follow vs. when to question rules

*Remember:* The key is creating experiences where learners must make judgment calls rather than simply following procedures, while maintaining the satirical aesthetic that makes AlgoCratic Futuresâ„¢ engaging and memorable.
