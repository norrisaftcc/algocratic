## COURSE DESCRIPTION

AlgoCratic Futures™ is an immersive software development course that teaches essential programming skills through a satirical corporate dystopian simulation. Students progress through "clearance levels" while completing increasingly complex assignments that mirror real-world software development challenges. The course combines technical skill development with professional resilience training, using humor and absurdity to create memorable learning experiences while preparing students for the unexpected realities of software development careers.

### Core Pedagogical Approach
- **Experiential Learning**: Students learn by doing, facing realistic (albeit exaggerated) workplace scenarios
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Course complexity and "reality" revealed gradually as students advance
- **Hypnotic Language Patterns**: Ericksonian NLP techniques decrease as students gain competence and autonomy
- **Satirical Scaffolding**: Humor reduces anxiety while maintaining engagement through challenging material
- **Professional Resilience**: Building adaptability and problem-solving skills for complex workplace situations
