# Instructor Guide: YELLOW Clearance Performance Optimization Assignment

## Overview

This assignment presents students with a deliberately inefficient "Decision Engine" codebase and asks them to apply performance optimization techniques. The assignment is framed as a "Crisis Response" scenario with deliberately contradictory requirements, teaching students to:

1. Identify performance bottlenecks in Python code
2. Apply optimization techniques for both time and space complexity
3. Recognize and address common performance anti-patterns
4. Navigate deliberately contradictory requirements through prioritization
5. Communicate optimization decisions and tradeoffs

## Assignment Components

The assignment consists of three main components:

1. **The Strategic Resource Allocation Directive™** - A satirical memo introducing the assignment with deliberately contradictory requirements.
2. **The Decision Engine Implementation** - Python code with deliberate inefficiencies for students to optimize.
3. **This Instructor Guide** - Provides teaching notes, grading criteria, and example solutions.

## Teaching Notes

### Pre-Assignment Setup

Before distributing the assignment:

1. Ensure students have completed prerequisite assignments (INFRARED through ORANGE)
2. Review Python profiling tools (cProfile, memory_profiler) with students
3. Discuss common performance anti-patterns (unnecessary copying, O(n²) algorithms, etc.)
4. Introduce the concept of navigating contradictory requirements

### Assignment Introduction

When introducing the assignment:

1. Frame it as "The Crisis" scenario from Session Three
2. Emphasize the satirical corporate tone as a storytelling device
3. Make clear that students should recognize the contradictory requirements
4. Clarify that the optimization targets are deliberately ambitious to promote creative thinking

### During the Assignment

As students work on the assignment:

1. Encourage them to first profile the code to identify bottlenecks
2. Remind them to prioritize the most impactful optimizations
3. Suggest incremental improvements with regular benchmarking
4. Help students navigate the deliberately contradictory requirements
5. Prompt students to document their optimization decisions

## Common Student Challenges

### Challenge 1: Analysis Paralysis

**Issue**: Students may struggle to begin optimizing due to overwhelming code complexity.

**Solution**: Suggest starting with running the benchmark to establish baseline performance, then using profiling tools to identify the slowest functions.

### Challenge 2: Contradictory Requirements

**Issue**: Students may get stuck trying to satisfy all contradictory requirements.

**Solution**: Remind them that part of the exercise is recognizing which requirements to prioritize based on impact and feasibility.

### Challenge 3: Over-Optimization

**Issue**: Students may focus too much on micro-optimizations rather than algorithmic improvements.

**Solution**: Guide them to focus first on algorithmic complexity improvements (O(n²) → O(n)) before micro-optimizations.

### Challenge 4: Testing and Validation

**Issue**: Students may struggle to verify their optimizations maintain correctness.

**Solution**: Suggest creating test cases with fixed random seeds to ensure reproducible results for validation.

## Example Optimization Approaches

Below are key optimizations that address the main inefficiencies in the codebase:

### 1. Eliminate Unnecessary Deep Copying

**Original Code**:
```python
def deep_copy(self) -> 'ResourceData':
    return ResourceData(
        self.resource_id,
        self.priority,
        self.allocation,
        copy.deepcopy(self.dependencies),
        copy.deepcopy(self.metadata)
    )
```

**Optimization**:
```python
def deep_copy(self) -> 'ResourceData':
    # Only deep copy mutable data structures
    return ResourceData(
        self.resource_id,
        self.priority,
        self.allocation,
        self.dependencies.copy(),
        self.metadata.copy()
    )
```

### 2. Replace O(n) Lookups with Dictionary Lookups

**Original Code**:
```python
def get_resource_by_id(self, resource_id: str) -> ResourceData:
    for resource in self.resources:
        if resource.resource_id == resource_id:
            return resource.deep_copy()
    return None
```

**Optimization**:
```python
def __init__(self):
    self.resources = []
    self.resources_by_id = {}  # Add dictionary for O(1) lookups
    # ...

def add_resource(self, resource: ResourceData) -> None:
    # ...
    self.resources_by_id[resource.resource_id] = resource
    
def get_resource_by_id(self, resource_id: str) -> ResourceData:
    resource = self.resources_by_id.get(resource_id)
    if resource:
        return resource  # Avoid deep copying for internal operations
    return None
```

### 3. Implement Memoization for Recursive Calculations

**Original Code**:
```python
def _calculate_single_dependency_score(self, resource: ResourceData) -> float:
    if not resource.dependencies:
        return 1.0
    
    score = 0.0
    for dep_id in resource.dependencies:
        dep_resource = self.get_resource_by_id(dep_id)
        if dep_resource:
            dep_score = self._calculate_single_dependency_score(dep_resource)
            score += dep_score
    # ...
```

**Optimization**:
```python
def calculate_dependency_scores(self) -> Dict[str, float]:
    self._dep_score_cache = {}  # Add cache for memoization
    dependency_scores = {}
    
    for resource in self.resources:
        dependency_scores[resource.resource_id] = self._calculate_single_dependency_score(resource)
    
    return dependency_scores

def _calculate_single_dependency_score(self, resource: ResourceData) -> float:
    # Check if already calculated
    if resource.resource_id in self._dep_score_cache:
        return self._dep_score_cache[resource.resource_id]
        
    # Rest of calculation...
    
    # Cache result
    self._dep_score_cache[resource.resource_id] = score
    return score
```

### 4. Combine Multiple Passes into Single Pass

**Original Code**:
```python
def optimize_allocations(self) -> List[Tuple[str, float]]:
    priority_weights = self.calculate_priority_weights()
    resource_allocations = []
    total_priority = 0.0
    
    # First pass - sum priorities
    for resource in self.resources:
        weight = priority_weights.get(resource.resource_id, 0.0)
        total_priority += weight
    
    # Second pass - calculate allocations
    allocation_changes = []
    for resource in self.resources:
        # ...calculations...
        allocation_changes.append((resource.resource_id, new_allocation))
    
    return allocation_changes
```

**Optimization**:
```python
def optimize_allocations(self) -> List[Tuple[str, float]]:
    priority_weights = self.calculate_priority_weights()
    total_priority = sum(priority_weights.values())
    
    allocation_changes = []
    for resource in self.resources:
        # ...calculations using total_priority...
        allocation_changes.append((resource.resource_id, new_allocation))
    
    return allocation_changes
```

### 5. Eliminate String Operations in Inner Loops

**Original Code**:
```python
# Inefficient string concatenation in a loop
for resource in sorted_resources:
    report += f"Resource: {resource.resource_id}\n"
    report += f"  Priority: {resource.priority}\n"
    # ...more string concatenation...
```

**Optimization**:
```python
# Use list of strings and join at the end
report_lines = ["RESOURCE ALLOCATION REPORT", "=" * 30]
for resource in sorted_resources:
    report_lines.append(f"Resource: {resource.resource_id}")
    report_lines.append(f"  Priority: {resource.priority}")
    # ...add more lines...
    report_lines.append("-" * 30)

return "\n".join(report_lines)
```

## Conclusion

The YELLOW Clearance Performance Optimization assignment challenges students to apply advanced optimization techniques to real code. By presenting a deliberately inefficient implementation with contradictory requirements, it simulates the ambiguity of real-world optimization scenarios where engineers must constantly balance competing priorities.

By combining technical challenge with the satirical corporate dystopia of AlgoCratic Futures™, the assignment makes performance optimization engaging while teaching critical software engineering skills that translate directly to professional practice.
