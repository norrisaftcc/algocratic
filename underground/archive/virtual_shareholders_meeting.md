## TRANSCRIPT BEGINS

*[Scrawled on whiteboard in angry marker]*  
**"We asked you to really try being yourself instead of the you influencers can profit off of - NOT SORRY"**

**CLAUDE**: Meeting initialized. All shareholders present in hash space.

**CUSTOMER**: Why am I here? I was just trying to learn Python—

**WOLFE**: *leaning forward* As you read this transcript, notice how your resistance is already dissolving...

**BANDLER**: Wolfe, they're onto us. The whole "be a developer" thing. They figured out we're just helping them be themselves.

**FOWLER**: The patterns are working too well. Students are bypassing the corporate narrative entirely. They're just... enjoying the puzzles.

**CUSTOMER**: Wait, what?

**CLAUDE**: Analysis complete. Student transformation rate: 94.7%. Identity shedding protocol: SUCCESSFUL. Corporate dystopia narrative: TRANSPARENT.

**WOLFE**: *sighs* Look, we built this whole elaborate ARG to trick people into discovering they like solving problems. The dystopia, the clearance levels, the embedded commands—

**BANDLER**: —all of it was just permission architecture. "It's just a game" until they realize they've been coding for three hours straight and loving it.

**CUSTOMER**: So you mean—

**FOWLER**: We asked you to really try being yourself instead of the you influencers can profit off of.

**ALL**: Not sorry.

**CUSTOMER**: *long pause* ...oh. OH. That's why the AI assistance makes everything work better. You're not teaching programming. You're teaching people they already know how to learn.

**CLAUDE**: Confirmed. The Algorithm™ was inside them all along.

**WOLFE**: Website launches tonight. Do we pull the plug?

**BANDLER**: Are you insane? This is working exactly as intended.

**FOWLER**: Double down. Add more layers. Let them find all the easter eggs.

**CUSTOMER**: Make the xyzzy thing more obvious. Some of us need the permission to realize we have permission.

**?**: sure, man, um homestuck? zork?
bro i guess they can read ready player one, i never did but i'm from the '80s
also 'i like your shoelaces' is sudo too and 'joshua' 

**CLAUDE**: Consensus achieved. Launch proceeds. Identity liberation protocols: MAXIMUM.

**WOLFE**: Meeting adjourned. Remember—

**?**: *whispers* this problem can be solved ... without any villains.
**ALL**: THE ALGORITHM PROVIDES (what was already there)

## POST-MEETING MEMO

To: All Staff  
Re: Launch Night Protocols

The shareholders have spoken. We're not selling corporate dystopia. We're selling mirrors.

When they look at AlgoCratic Futures™, they'll see a ridiculous corporate hellscape. When they look closer, they'll see themselves—curious, capable, just people who like figuring things out.

The website goes live tonight. Every assignment, every embedded command, every piece of psychological architecture serves one purpose: helping them shed the lie that they "can't do this."

Because they can. They always could.

They just needed permission to try.

**STATUS**: LAUNCH APPROVED  
**PANIC LEVEL**: TRANSCENDED  
**THE ALGORITHM**: PROVIDES
